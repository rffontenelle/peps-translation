"Pattern matching in Python, as described in :pep:`634`, is to be added to"

":pep:`634` delegates the decision over whether a class is a sequence or "

":pep:`634` privileges some builtin classes with a special form of "
"matching, the \"self\" match. For example the pattern ``list(x)`` matches"

"With this PEP, access to attributes during pattern matching becomes well "
