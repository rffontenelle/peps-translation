"PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.  A PEP is a design document "

"concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the "
"feature."

"We intend PEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new "
"features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting "

"responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting "
"dissenting opinions."

"Because the PEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, "

"A **Standards Track** PEP describes a new feature or implementation for "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0001.txt:58
msgid ""
"An **Informational** PEP describes a Python design issue, or provides "

"free to ignore Informational PEPs or follow their advice."

msgid ""
"A **Process** PEP describes a process surrounding Python, or proposes a "
"change to (or an event in) a process.  Process PEPs are like Standards Track "
"PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself.  They may "
"propose an implementation, but not to Python's codebase; they often require "
"community consensus; unlike Informational PEPs, they are more than "
"recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples "
"include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and "
"changes to the tools or environment used in Python development. Any meta-PEP "
