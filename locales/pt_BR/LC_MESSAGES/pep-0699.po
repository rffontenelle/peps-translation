msgid ""
":pep:`509` introduced a private ``ma_version_tag`` field for dictionaries"
" to allow optimizations in CPython and extension libraries. This PEP "
"proposes to rescind :pep:`509` and declare the field an implementation "
"detail, as it has already been superseded by alternatives. This will "
"further allow the field to be reused for future optimization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:27
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:29
msgid ""
":pep:`509` introduced the ``ma_version_tag`` field to dictionaries. This "
"64-bit field stored a version counter that updates every time a "
"dictionary was modified. The original proposal was to use this version "
"counter as a guard for optimizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:34
msgid ""
"Since CPython 3.11, this field has become unused by internal optimization"
" efforts. :pep:`659`-specialized instructions use other methods of "
"verifying that certain optimizations are safe."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:38
msgid ""
"To enable further optimizations in CPython, this PEP proposes that the "
"``ma_version_tag`` field no longer conform to the :pep:`509` "
"specification. This will allow the CPython developers to store other "
"optimization information, such as dictionary write watchers."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:46
msgid ""
"This PEP does not specify what the field may be used for in the future. "
"This is intentional, as implementation details are subject to change, and"
" the field should be used only for internal consumption by CPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:52
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:54
msgid ""
"This specification rescinds that in :pep:`509`. The ``ma_version_tag`` "
"field of the Python :class:`dict` class is declared to be an internal "
"implementation detail and may be removed altogether, or may have a "
"different representation. C extensions should not rely on this field."

"Certain extensions use ``ma_version_tag`` for fast dictionary or globals "
"lookups. For example, `Cython uses the field for fast dynamic module "
"variable lookups "

#: ../../peps/pep-0699.rst:86
msgid ""
"A possible alternative is to preserve the field for backwards "
"compatibility. This PEP rejects that alternative as future optimizations "
"will consume more memory, and the field was always considered private and"
" undocumented aside from the PEP, with no backward compatibility "
"guarantees. Dictionaries in Python are commonly used, and any increase in"
" their memory consumption will adversely affect Python’s performance."
