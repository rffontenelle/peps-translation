"The \\*\\*kwargs syntax in a function definition indicates that the "
"interpreter should collect all keyword arguments that do not correspond "
"to other named parameters.  However, Python does not preserved the order "
"in which those collected keyword arguments were passed to the function.  "

"Python's \\*\\*kwargs syntax in function definitions provides a powerful "

"Currently to preserved the order you have to do so manually and "
