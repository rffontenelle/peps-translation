"constant ``math.tau`` to the Python standard library."

msgid ""
"The concept of ``tau`` (``τ``) is based on the observation that the ratio"
" of a circle's circumference to its radius is far more fundamental and "
"interesting than the ratio between its circumference and diameter. It is "
"simply a matter of assigning a name to the value ``2 * pi`` (``2π``)."

msgid "The Rationale for Tau"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0628.rst:42
msgid ""
"``pi`` is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its "
"diameter. However, a circle is defined by its centre point and its "
"*radius*. This is shown clearly when we note that the parameter of "
"integration to go from a circle's circumference to its area is the "
"radius, not the diameter. If we use the diameter instead we have to "
"divide by four to get rid of the extraneous multiplier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0628.rst:49
msgid ""
"When working with radians, it is trivial to convert any given fraction of"
" a circle to a value in radians in terms of ``tau``. A quarter circle is "
"``tau/4``, a half circle is ``tau/2``, seven 25ths is ``7*tau/25``, etc. "
"In contrast with the equivalent expressions in terms of ``pi`` (``pi/2``,"
" ``pi``, ``14*pi/25``), the unnecessary and needlessly confusing "
"multiplication by two is gone."

" some more resources that may be of interest:"
