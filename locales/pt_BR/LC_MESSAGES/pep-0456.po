"Despite the last attempt [issue13703]_ CPython is still vulnerable to "
"hash collision DoS attacks [29c3]_ [issue14621]_. The current hash "
"algorithm and its randomization is not resilient against attacks. Only a "
"proper cryptographic hash function prevents the extraction of secret "
"randomization keys. Although no practical attack against a Python-based "
"service has been seen yet, the weakness has to be fixed. Jean-Philippe "
