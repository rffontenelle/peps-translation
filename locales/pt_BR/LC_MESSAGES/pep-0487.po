"Metaclasses are a powerful tool to customize class creation. They have, "

"This need often occurs as a surprise to a user: inheriting from two base "

"interested in those details about the libraries at all. This becomes even"
" worse if one library starts to make use of a metaclass which it has not "
"done before. While the library itself continues to work perfectly, "

"While there are many possible ways to use a metaclass, the vast majority "

"The base class ``object`` contains an empty ``__init_subclass__`` method "
"which serves as an endpoint for cooperative multiple inheritance. Note "

" are more specialized have to process all keyword arguments."

"This general proposal is not a new idea (it was first suggested for "
"inclusion in the language definition `more than 10 years ago`_, and a "
"similar mechanism has long been supported by `Zope's ExtensionClass`_), "
"but the situation has changed sufficiently in recent years that the idea "
"is worth reconsidering for inclusion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0487.rst:93

"The second part of the proposal adds an ``__set_name__`` initializer for "
"class attributes, especially if they are descriptors. Descriptors are "
"defined in the body of a class, but they do not know anything about that "
"class, they do not even know the name they are accessed with. They do get"
" to know their owner once ``__get__`` is called, but still they do not "
"know their name. This is unfortunate, for example they cannot put their "
"associated value into their object's ``__dict__`` under their name, since"
" they do not know that name.  This problem has been solved many times, "
"and is one of the most important reasons to have a metaclass in a "
"library. While it would be easy to implement such a mechanism using the "
"first part of the proposal, it makes sense to have one solution for this "

"Initializing descriptors could simply be done in the "

"Understanding Python's metaclasses requires a deep understanding of the "

"One of the big issues that makes library authors reluctant to use "

"By contrast, adding an ``__init_subclass__`` method to an existing type "

"The hooks are called in the following order: ``type.__new__`` calls the "
"``__set_name__`` hooks on the descriptor after the new class has been "

"``super()``, to be precise. This means that subclass initializers already"

"users can fix all descriptors again if this is needed."

#: ../../peps/pep-0487.rst:243

"Another option would have been to call ``__set_name__`` in the base "
"implementation of ``object.__init_subclass__``. This way it would be "

"As a third option, all the work could have been done in "
"``type.__init__``. Most metaclasses do their work in ``__new__``, as this"
" is recommended by the documentation. Many metaclasses modify their "
"arguments before they pass them over to ``super().__new__``. For "
"compatibility with those kind of classes, the hooks should be called from"
" ``__new__``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0487.rst:255
msgid ""
"Another small change should be done: in the current implementation of "
"CPython, ``type.__init__`` explicitly forbids the use of keyword "
"arguments, while ``type.__new__`` allows for its attributes to be shipped"
" as keyword arguments. This is weirdly incoherent, and thus it should be "
"forbidden. While it would be possible to retain the current behavior, it "
"would be better if this was fixed, as it is probably not used at all: the"
" only use case would be that at metaclass calls its ``super().__new__`` "
"with *name*, *bases* and *dict* (yes, *dict*, not *namespace* or *ns* as "
"mostly used with modern metaclasses) as keyword arguments. This should "
"not be done. This little change simplifies the implementation of this PEP"
" significantly, while improving the coherence of Python overall."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0487.rst:267
msgid ""
"As a second change, the new ``type.__init__`` just ignores keyword "
"arguments. Currently, it insists that no keyword arguments are given. "
"This leads to a (wanted) error if one gives keyword arguments to a class "
"declaration if the metaclass does not process them. Metaclass authors "
"that do want to accept keyword arguments must filter them out by "
"overriding ``__init__``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0487.rst:273

"In the new code, it is not ``__init__`` that complains about keyword "
"arguments, but ``__init_subclass__``, whose default implementation takes "
