#: ../pep-0426.txt:109
msgid ""
"The purpose of this PEP is to define a common metadata interchange format "
"for communication between software publication tools and software "
"integration tools in the Python ecosystem. One key aim is to support full "
"dependency analysis in that ecosystem without requiring the execution of "
"arbitrary Python code by those doing the analysis. Another aim is to "
"encourage good software distribution practices by default, while continuing "
"to support the current practices of almost all existing users of the Python "
"Package Index (both publishers and integrators). Finally, the aim is to "
"support an upgrade path from the currently in use metadata formats that is "
"transparent to end users."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:120
msgid ""
"The design draws on the Python community's nearly 20 years of experience "
"with distutils based software distribution, and incorporates ideas and "
"concepts from other distribution systems, including Python's setuptools, pip "
"and other projects, Ruby's gems, Perl's CPAN, Node.js's npm, PHP's composer "
"and Linux packaging systems such as RPM and APT."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:126
msgid ""
"While the specifics of this format are aimed at the Python ecosystem, some "
"of the ideas may also be useful in the future evolution of other dependency "

msgid "Development, Distribution and Deployment of Python Software"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:134
msgid ""
"The metadata design in this PEP is based on a particular conceptual model of "
"the software development and distribution process. This model consists of "
"the following phases:"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:138
msgid ""
"Software development: this phase involves working with a source checkout for "
"a particular application to add features and fix bugs. It is expected that "
"developers in this phase will need to be able to build the software, run the "
"software's automated test suite, run project specific utility scripts and "
"publish the software."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:144
msgid ""
"Software publication: this phase involves taking the developed software and "
"making it available for use by software integrators. This includes creating "
"the descriptive metadata defined in this PEP, as well as making the software "
"available (typically by uploading it to an index server)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:149
msgid ""
"Software integration: this phase involves taking published software "
"components and combining them into a coherent, integrated system. This may "
"be done directly using Python specific cross-platform tools, or it may be "
"handled through conversion to development language neutral platform specific "
"packaging systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:155
msgid ""
"Software deployment: this phase involves taking integrated software "
"components and deploying them on to the target system where the software "
"will actually execute."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:159
msgid ""
"The publication and integration phases are collectively referred to as the "
"distribution phase, and the individual software components distributed in "
"that phase are formally referred to as \"distribution packages\", but are "
"more colloquially known as just \"packages\" (relying on context to "
"disambiguate them from the \"module with submodules\" kind of Python "
"package)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0426.txt:165
msgid ""
"The exact details of these phases will vary greatly for particular use "
"cases. Deploying a web application to a public Platform-as-a-Service "
"provider, publishing a new release of a web framework or scientific library, "
"creating an integrated Linux distribution, or upgrading a custom application "
"running in a secure enclave are all situations this metadata design should "
"be able to handle."
msgstr ""
