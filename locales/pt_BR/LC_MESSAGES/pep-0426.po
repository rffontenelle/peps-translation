msgid ""
"The purpose of this PEP is to define a common metadata interchange format"
" for communication between software publication tools and software "

" dependency analysis in that ecosystem without requiring the execution of"
" arbitrary Python code by those doing the analysis. Another aim is to "
"encourage good software distribution practices by default, while "
"continuing to support the current practices of almost all existing users "
"of the Python Package Index (both publishers and integrators). Finally, "
"the aim is to support an upgrade path from the currently in use metadata "
"formats that is transparent to end users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0426.rst:120
msgid ""
"The design draws on the Python community's nearly 20 years of experience "
"with distutils based software distribution, and incorporates ideas and "

"pip and other projects, Ruby's gems, Perl's CPAN, Node.js's npm, PHP's "
"composer and Linux packaging systems such as RPM and APT."

msgid ""
"Software development: this phase involves working with a source checkout "

"utility scripts and publish the software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0426.rst:144
msgid ""
"Software publication: this phase involves taking the developed software "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0426.rst:149

"platform specific packaging systems."
msgstr ""

"However, neither of the given examples is particularly compelling, since "
"Pillow/PIL style forks aren't common, and the database driver use case "
"would arguably be better served by an SQL Alchemy defined \"supported "
"database driver\" metadata extension where a project depends on SQL "
"Alchemy, and then declares in the extension which database drivers are "
"checked for compatibility by the upstream project."

":pep:`440` defines a rich syntax for version comparisons that could "
"potentially be useful with ``python_version`` and ``python_full_version``"
" in environment markers. However, allowing the full syntax would mean "
"environment markers are no longer a Python subset, while allowing only "
"some of the comparisons would introduce yet another special case to "
"handle."

"Given that environment markers are only used in cases where a higher "
"level \"or\" is implied by the metadata structure, it seems easier to "
"require the use of multiple comparisons against specific Python versions "
"for the rare cases where this would be useful."

"Under the revised metadata design, conditional \"provides\" based on "
"runtime features or the environment would go in a separate "
"\"may_provide\" field. However, it isn't clear there's any use case for "
"doing that, so the idea is rejected unless someone can present a "
"compelling use case (and even then the idea won't be reconsidered until "
"metadata 2.1 at the earliest)."
