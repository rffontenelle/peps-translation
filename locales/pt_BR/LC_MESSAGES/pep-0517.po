"**First**, because there will likely be only a small number of build "

"That is, this PEP leads to less total code in the overall ecosystem. And "

"system. For example, this is a complete, working build backend::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0517.rst:855
msgid ""
"Of course, this is a *terrible* build backend: it requires the user to "
"have manually set up the wheel metadata in ``src/mypackage-0.1.dist-"
"info/``; when the version number changes it must be manually updated in "
"multiple places... but it works, and more features could be added "
"incrementally. Much experience suggests that large successful projects "
"often originate as quick hacks (e.g., Linux -- \"just a hobby, won't be "
"big and professional\"; `IPython/Jupyter "

"of a vibrant ecosystem of good build tools, it's important to minimize "
"the barrier to entry."

"**Second**, because Python provides a simpler yet richer structure for "
"describing interfaces, we remove unnecessary complexity from the "
"specification -- and specifications are the worst place for complexity, "
"because changing specifications requires painful consensus-building "
"across many stakeholders. In the command-line interface approach, we have"

"into a single linear command line (e.g. how do we avoid collisions "
"between user-specified configuration arguments and PEP-defined arguments?"
" how do we specify optional arguments? when working with a Python "
"interface these questions have simple, obvious answers). When spawning "
"and managing subprocesses, there are many fiddly details that must be "
"gotten right, subtle cross-platform differences, and some of the most "
"obvious approaches -- e.g., using stdout to return data for the "
"``build_requires`` operation -- can create unexpected pitfalls (e.g., "
"what happens when computing the build requirements requires spawning some"
" child processes, and these children occasionally print an error message "
"to stdout? obviously a careful build backend author can avoid this "
"problem, but the most obvious way of defining a Python interface removes "

"demarcated)."
