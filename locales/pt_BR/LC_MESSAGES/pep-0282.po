"This PEP describes a proposed logging package for Python's standard library."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0282.txt:19
msgid ""
"Basically the system involves the user creating one or more logger objects "

"To support use of the logging mechanism in short scripts and small "
"applications, module-level functions ``debug()``, ``info()``, ``warn()``, "
"``error()``, ``critical()`` and ``exception()`` are provided.  These work in "
"the same way as the correspondingly named methods of Logger - in fact they "
"delegate to the corresponding methods on the root logger.  A further "
"convenience provided by these functions is that if no configuration has been "
"done, ``basicConfig()`` is automatically called."
