"This PEP proposes to expand CPython's C API [#c-api]_ to allow for the "
"specification of a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the "
"evaluation of frames [#pyeval_evalframeex]_. This proposal also suggests "
"adding a new field to code objects [#pycodeobject]_ to store arbitrary "
"data for use by the frame evaluation function."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0523.rst:27
msgid ""
"One place where flexibility has been lacking in Python is in the direct "
"execution of Python code. While CPython's C API [#c-api]_ allows for "
"constructing the data going into a frame object and then evaluating it "
"via ``PyEval_EvalFrameEx()`` [#pyeval_evalframeex]_, control over the "
"execution of Python code comes down to individual objects instead of a "
"holistic control of execution at the frame level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0523.rst:34
msgid ""
"While wanting to have influence over frame evaluation may seem a bit too "
"low-level, it does open the possibility for things such as a method-level"
" JIT to be introduced into CPython without CPython itself having to "
"provide one. By allowing external C code to control frame evaluation, a "
"JIT can participate in the execution of Python code at the key point "
"where evaluation occurs. This then allows for a JIT to conditionally "
"recompile Python bytecode to machine code as desired while still allowing"
" for executing regular CPython bytecode when running the JIT is not "
"desired. This can be accomplished by allowing interpreters to specify "
"what function to call to evaluate a frame. And by placing the API at the "
"frame evaluation level it allows for a complete view of the execution "
"environment of the code for the JIT."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0523.rst:47
msgid ""
"This ability to specify a frame evaluation function also allows for other"
" use-cases beyond just opening CPython up to a JIT. For instance, it "
"would not be difficult to implement a tracing or profiling function at "
"the call level with this API. While CPython does provide the ability to "
"set a tracing or profiling function at the Python level, this would be "
"able to match the data collection of the profiler and quite possibly be "
"faster for tracing by simply skipping per-line tracing support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0523.rst:56
msgid ""
"It also opens up the possibility of debugging where the frame evaluation "
"function only performs special debugging work when it detects it is about"
" to execute a specific code object. In that instance the bytecode could "
"be theoretically rewritten in-place to inject a breakpoint function call "
"at the proper point for help in debugging while not having to do a heavy-"
"handed approach as required by ``sys.settrace()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0523.rst:64
msgid ""
"To help facilitate these use-cases, we are also proposing the adding of a"
" \"scratch space\" on code objects via a new field. This will allow per-"
"code object data to be stored with the code object itself for easy "
"retrieval by the frame evaluation function as necessary. The field itself"
" will simply be a ``PyObject *`` type so that any data stored in the "
"field will participate in normal object memory management."

"Originally this PEP was going to propose a much larger API change which "

"[#numba]_, though, it became clear that the API was unnecessarily large. "

"opportunity to provide a trampoline function to handle execution of "
"Python code that had been JIT-compiled and a way to attach that compiled "

"While discussing this PEP at PyCon US 2016, some core developers "

"The view of this PEP is that the ``co_extra`` field doesn't change the "
