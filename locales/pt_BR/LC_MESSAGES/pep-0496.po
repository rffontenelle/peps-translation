"After this PEP was initially drafted, :pep:`508` was developed and "
"submitted to fully specify the dependency declaration syntax, including "
"environment markers. As a result, this PEP ended up being rejected in "
"favour of the more comprehensive :pep:`508`."

msgid ""
"An **environment marker** describes a condition about the current "
"execution environment. They are used to indicate when certain "
"dependencies are only required in particular environments, and to "
"indicate supported platforms for distributions with additional "
"constraints beyond the availability of a Python runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0496.rst:30
msgid ""
"Environment markers were first specified in :pep:`345`. :pep:`426` (which"
" would replace :pep:`345`) proposed extensions to the markers. When "
"2.7.10 was released, even these extensions became insufficient due to "
"their reliance on simple lexical comparisons, and thus this PEP has been "
"born."

msgid "Many Python packages are written with portability in mind."

"For many packages this means they aim to support a wide range of Python "
"releases. If they depend on libraries such as ``argparse`` - which "
"started as external libraries, but later got incorporated into core - "
"specifying a single set of requirements is difficult, as the set of "
"required packages differs depending on the version of Python in use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0496.rst:47
msgid ""
"For other packages, designing for portability means supporting multiple "
"operating systems. However, the significant differences between them may "
"mean that particular dependencies are only needed on particular platforms"
