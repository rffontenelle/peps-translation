msgid ""
":pep:`340`, Anonymous Block Statements, combined many powerful ideas: "
"using generators as block templates, adding exception handling and "
"finalization to generators, and more.  Besides praise it received a lot "
"of opposition from people who didn't like the fact that it was, under the"
" covers, a (potential) looping construct.  This meant that break and "
"continue in a block-statement would break or continue the block-"
"statement, even if it was used as a non-looping resource management tool."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:86
msgid ""
"But the final blow came when I read Raymond Chen's rant about flow-"
"control macros [1]_.  Raymond argues convincingly that hiding flow "
"control in macros makes your code inscrutable, and I find that his "
"argument applies to Python as well as to C.  I realized that :pep:`340` "
"templates can hide all sorts of control flow; for example, its example 4 "
"(``auto_retry()``) catches exceptions and repeats the block up to three "
"times."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:94
msgid ""
"However, the with-statement of :pep:`310` does **not** hide control flow,"
" in my view: while a finally-suite temporarily suspends the control flow,"
" in the end, the control flow resumes as if the finally-suite wasn't "
"there at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:99
msgid ""
"Remember, :pep:`310` proposes roughly this syntax (the \"VAR =\" part is "
"optional)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:105
msgid "which roughly translates into this::"

#: ../pep-0343.txt:114
msgid "Now consider this example::"

#: ../pep-0343.txt:120
msgid ""
"Here, just as if the first line was \"if True\" instead, we know that if "
"``BLOCK1`` completes without an exception, BLOCK2 will be reached; and if"
" ``BLOCK1`` raises an exception or executes a non-local goto (a break, "
"continue or return), ``BLOCK2`` is **not** reached.  The magic added by "
"the with-statement at the end doesn't affect this."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:126
msgid ""
"(You may ask, what if a bug in the ``__exit__()`` method causes an "
"exception?  Then all is lost -- but this is no worse than with other "
"exceptions; the nature of exceptions is that they can happen "
"**anywhere**, and you just have to live with that.  Even if you write "
"bug-free code, a KeyboardInterrupt exception can still cause it to exit "
"between any two virtual machine opcodes.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:133
msgid ""
"This argument almost led me to endorse :pep:`310`, but I had one idea "
"left from the :pep:`340` euphoria that I wasn't ready to drop: using "
"generators as \"templates\" for abstractions like acquiring and releasing"
" a lock or opening and closing a file is a powerful idea, as can be seen "
"by looking at the examples in that PEP."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:139
msgid ""
"Inspired by a counter-proposal to :pep:`340` by Phillip Eby I tried to "
"create a decorator that would turn a suitable generator into an object "
"with the necessary ``__enter__()`` and ``__exit__()`` methods. Here I ran"
" into a snag: while it wasn't too hard for the locking example, it was "
"impossible to do this for the opening example. The idea was to define the"
" template like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:154
msgid "and used it like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:159
msgid ""
"The problem is that in :pep:`310`, the result of calling ``EXPR`` is "
"assigned directly to ``VAR``, and then ``VAR``'s ``__exit__()`` method is"
" called upon exit from ``BLOCK1``.  But here, ``VAR`` clearly needs to "
"receive the opened file, and that would mean that ``__exit__()`` would "
"have to be a method on the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:165
msgid ""
"While this can be solved using a proxy class, this is awkward and made me"
" realize that a slightly different translation would make writing the "
"desired decorator a piece of cake: let ``VAR`` receive the result from "
"calling the ``__enter__()`` method, and save the value of ``EXPR`` to "
"call its ``__exit__()`` method later.  Then the decorator can return an "
"instance of a wrapper class whose ``__enter__()`` method calls the "
"generator's ``next()`` method and returns whatever ``next()`` returns; "
"the wrapper instance's ``__exit__()`` method calls ``next()`` again but "
"expects it to raise StopIteration.  (Details below in the section "
"Optional Generator Decorator.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:176
msgid "So now the final hurdle was that the :pep:`310` syntax::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:181
msgid ""
"would be deceptive, since ``VAR`` does **not** receive the value of "
"``EXPR``.  Borrowing from :pep:`340`, it was an easy step to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:187
msgid ""
"Additional discussion showed that people really liked being able to "
"\"see\" the exception in the generator, even if it was only to log it; "
"the generator is not allowed to yield another value, since the with-"
"statement should not be usable as a loop (raising a different exception "
"is marginally acceptable).  To enable this, a new ``throw()`` method for "
"generators is proposed, which takes one to three arguments representing "
"an exception in the usual fashion (type, value, traceback) and raises it "
"at the point where the generator is suspended."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:197
msgid ""
"Once we have this, it is a small step to proposing another generator "
"method, ``close()``, which calls ``throw()`` with a special exception, "
"``GeneratorExit``.  This tells the generator to exit, and from there it's"
" another small step to proposing that ``close()`` be called automatically"
" when the generator is garbage-collected."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:203
msgid ""
"Then, finally, we can allow a yield-statement inside a try-finally "
"statement, since we can now guarantee that the finally-clause will "
"(eventually) be executed.  The usual cautions about finalization apply --"
" the process may be terminated abruptly without finalizing any objects, "
"and objects may be kept alive forever by cycles or memory leaks in the "
"application (as opposed to cycles or leaks in the Python implementation, "
"which are taken care of by GC)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:211
msgid ""
"Note that we're not guaranteeing that the finally-clause is executed "
"immediately after the generator object becomes unused, even though this "
"is how it will work in CPython.  This is similar to auto-closing files: "
"while a reference-counting implementation like CPython deallocates an "
"object as soon as the last reference to it goes away, implementations "
"that use other GC algorithms do not make the same guarantee.  This "
"applies to Jython, IronPython, and probably to Python running on Parrot."

" tried (``__exit__``, ``__enter__``). Similarly, if any of the calls "
"raises an exception, the effect is exactly as it would be in the above "
"code.  Finally, if ``BLOCK`` contains a break, continue or return "

"happened inside the with-statement.  However, if the with-statement was "
"left via a non-local goto (break, continue or return), this non-local "
"return is resumed when ``mgr.__exit__()`` returns regardless of the "
"return value.  The motivation for this detail is to make it possible for "
"``mgr.__exit__()`` to swallow exceptions, without making it too easy "
"(since the default return value, ``None``, is false and this causes the "
"exception to be re-raised).  The main use case for swallowing exceptions "
"is to make it possible to write the ``@contextmanager`` decorator so that"
" a try/except block in a decorated generator behaves exactly as if the "
"body of the generator were expanded in-line at the place of the with-"
"statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0343.txt:309
msgid ""
"The motivation for passing the exception details to ``__exit__()``, as "
"opposed to the argument-less ``__exit__()`` from :pep:`310`, was given by"
" the ``transactional()`` use case, example 3 below.  The template in that"
" example must commit or roll back the transaction depending on whether an"
" exception occurred or not.  Rather than just having a boolean flag "
"indicating whether an exception occurred, we pass the complete exception "
"information, for the benefit of an exception-logging facility for "
"example.  Relying on ``sys.exc_info()`` to get at the exception "
"information was rejected; ``sys.exc_info()`` has very complex semantics "
"and it is perfectly possible that it returns the exception information "
"for an exception that was caught ages ago.  It was also proposed to add "
"an additional boolean to distinguish between reaching the end of "
"``BLOCK`` and a non-local goto.  This was rejected as too complex and "
"unnecessary; a non-local goto should be considered unexceptional for the "
"purposes of a database transaction roll-back decision."

"To facilitate chaining of contexts in Python code that directly "
