"This PEP proposes a notation for positional-only parameters in Python. "
"Positional-only parameters are parameters without an externally-usable "
"name; when a function accepting positional-only parameters is called, "
"positional arguments are mapped to these parameters based solely on their"
" position."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:23
msgid ""
"This PEP is an Informational PEP describing the notation for use when "
"describing APIs that use positional-only parameters (e.g. in Argument "
"Clinic, or in the string representation of ``inspect.Signature`` "
"objects). A separate PEP, :pep:`570`, proposes elevation of this notation"
" to full Python syntax."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:33
msgid ""
"Python has always supported positional-only parameters. Early versions of"
" Python lacked the concept of specifying parameters by name, so naturally"
" all parameters were positional-only.  This changed around Python 1.0, "
"when all parameters suddenly became positional-or-keyword. But, even in "
"current versions of Python, many CPython \"builtin\" functions still only"
" accept positional-only arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:42
msgid ""
"Functions implemented in modern Python can accept an arbitrary number of "
"positional-only arguments, via the variadic ``*args`` parameter.  "
"However, there is no Python syntax to specify accepting a specific number"
" of positional-only parameters.  Put another way, there are many builtin "
"functions whose signatures are simply not expressible with Python syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:50
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes a notation for such signatures that could form the "
"basis of a backwards-compatible syntax that should permit implementing "
"any builtin in pure Python code (see :pep:`570` for that proposal)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Positional-Only Parameter Semantics In Current Python"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:58
msgid ""
"There are many, many examples of builtins that only accept positional-"
"only parameters.  The resulting semantics are easily experienced by the "
"Python programmer--just try calling one, specifying its arguments by "
"name::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:69
msgid ""
"In addition, there are some functions with particularly interesting "
"semantics:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:72
msgid ""
"``range()``, which accepts an optional parameter to the *left* of its "
"required parameter. [#RANGE]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:75
msgid ""
"``dict()``, whose mapping/iterator parameter is optional and semantically"
" must be positional-only.  Any externally visible name for this parameter"
" would occlude that name going into the ``**kwarg`` keyword variadic "
"parameter dict! [#DICT]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:81
msgid ""
"Obviously one can simulate any of these in pure Python code by accepting "
"``(*args, **kwargs)`` and parsing the arguments by hand.  But this "
"results in a disconnect between the Python function's signature and what "
"it actually accepts, not to mention the work of implementing said "
"argument parsing."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:91
msgid ""
"This PEP does not propose we implement positional-only parameters in "
"Python.  The goal of this PEP is simply to define the syntax, so that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:95
msgid ""
"Documentation can clearly, unambiguously, and consistently express "
"exactly how the arguments for a function will be interpreted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:99
msgid ""
"The syntax is reserved for future use, in case the community decides "
"someday to add positional-only parameters to the language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:103

"Argument Clinic can use a variant of the syntax as part of its input when"
" defining the arguments for built-in functions."

msgid "Some functions use *both* of the above approaches. [#RANGE]_ [#ADDCH]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:123
msgid ""
"One more important idea to consider: currently in the documentation "
"there's no way to tell whether a function takes positional-only "
"parameters.  ``open()`` accepts keyword arguments, ``ord()`` does not, "
"but there is no way of telling just by reading the documentation that "
"this is true."

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:133

"From the \"ten-thousand foot view\", and ignoring ``*args`` and "
"``**kwargs`` for now, the grammar for a function definition currently "
"looks like this::"

"All parameters before the ``/`` are positional-only.  If ``/`` is not "

"Positional-only parameters can have a default value, and if they do they "
"are optional.  Positional-only parameters that don't have a default value"

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:154

"Although positional-only parameter technically have names, these names "

"If there are arguments after the ``/``, then you must specify a comma "

"Argument Clinic uses a form of this syntax for specifying builtins.  It "
"imposes further limitations that are theoretically unnecessary but make "
"the implementation easier.  Specifically:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:174
msgid ""
"A function that has positional-only parameters currently cannot have any "
"other kind of parameter.  (This will probably be relaxed slightly in the "
"near future.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:178
msgid ""
"Argument Clinic supports an additional syntax called \"optional groups\"."
"  An \"optional group\" is a sequential set of positional-only parameters"
" that must be specified or not-specified as a group.  If, for example, "
"you define a function in Argument Clinic that takes four parameters, and "
"all of them are positional-only and in one optional group, then when "
"calling the function you must specify either zero arguments or four "
"arguments.  This is necessary to cover more of Python's legacy library, "
"but is outside the scope of this PEP, and is not recommended for actual "
"inclusion in the Python language."

msgid ""
"If we decide to implement positional-only parameters in a future version "
"of Python, we'd have to do some additional work to preserve their "
"semantics.  The problem: how do we inform a parameter that no value was "
"passed in for it when the function was called?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:199
msgid ""
"The obvious solution: add a new singleton constant to Python that is "
"passed in when a parameter is not mapped to an argument. I propose that "
"the value be called ``undefined``, and be a singleton of a special class "
"called ``Undefined``. If a positional-only parameter did not receive an "
"argument when called, its value would be set to ``undefined``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:206
msgid ""
"But this raises a further problem.  How do can we tell the difference "
"between \"this positional-only parameter did not receive an argument\" "
"and \"the caller passed in ``undefined`` for this parameter\"?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:211
msgid ""
"It'd be nice to make it illegal to pass ``undefined`` in as an argument "
"to a function--to, say, raise an exception. But that would slow Python "
"down, and the \"consenting adults\" rule appears applicable here.  So "
"making it illegal should probably be strongly discouraged but not "
"outright prevented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0457.rst:217

"However, it should be allowed (and encouraged) for user functions to "
"specify ``undefined`` as a default value for parameters."
