"This PEP proposed a list of standard library modules to be removed from "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:47
msgid ""
"Back in the early days of Python, the interpreter came with a large set "
"of useful modules. This was often referred to as \"batteries included\" "
"philosophy and was one of the cornerstones to Python's success story. "
"Users didn't have to figure out how to download and install separate "
"packages in order to write a simple web server or parse email."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:53
msgid ""
"Times have changed. With the introduction of PyPI (née Cheeseshop), "
"setuptools, and later pip, it became simple and straightforward to "
"download and install packages. Nowadays Python has a rich and vibrant "
"ecosystem of third-party packages. It's pretty much standard to either "
"install packages from PyPI or use one of the many Python or Linux "
"distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:59
msgid ""
"On the other hand, Python's standard library is piling up with cruft, "
"unnecessary duplication of functionality, and dispensable features. This "
"is undesirable for several reasons."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:63
msgid ""
"Any additional module increases the maintenance cost for the Python core "
"development team. The team has limited resources, reduced maintenance "
"cost frees development time for other improvements."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:66
msgid ""
"Modules in the standard library are generally favored and seen as the de "
"facto solution for a problem. A majority of users only pick third-party "
"modules to replace a stdlib module, when they have a compelling reason, "
"e.g. ``lxml`` instead of ``xml``. The removal of an unmaintained stdlib "
"module increases the chances of a community-contributed module to become "
"widely used."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:72
msgid ""
"A lean and mean standard library benefits platforms with limited "
"resources like devices with just a few hundred kilobyte of storage (e.g. "
"BBC Micro:bit). Python on mobile platforms like BeeWare or WebAssembly "
"(e.g. pyodide) also benefit from reduced download size."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:77
msgid ""
"The modules in this PEP have been selected for deprecation because their "
"removal is either least controversial or most beneficial. For example, "
"least controversial are 30-year-old multimedia formats like the ``sunau``"
" audio format, which was used on SPARC and NeXT workstations in the late "
"1980s. The ``crypt`` module has fundamental flaws that are better solved "
"outside the standard library."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0594.rst:84
msgid ""
"This PEP also designates some modules as not scheduled for removal. Some "
"modules have been deprecated for several releases or seem unnecessary at "
"first glance. However it is beneficial to keep the modules in the "
"standard library, mostly for environments where installing a package from"
" PyPI is not an option. This can be corporate environments or classrooms "
"where external code is not permitted without legal approval."
