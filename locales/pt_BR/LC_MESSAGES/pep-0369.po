msgid ""
"Python has no API to hook into the import machinery and execute code "

"A use case for a post import hook is mentioned in Alyssa (Nick) Coghlan's"
" initial posting [2]_. about callbacks on module import. It was found "
"during the development of Python 3.0 and its ABCs. We wanted to register "
"classes like decimal.Decimal with an ABC but the module should not be "
"imported on every interpreter startup. Alyssa came up with this example::"
