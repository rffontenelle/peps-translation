msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:23
msgid "There are two rationales for this PEP, both of which are somewhat subtle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:26
msgid ""
"The primary reason for changing the way metaclasses work, is that there "
"are a number of interesting use cases that require the metaclass to get "
"involved earlier in the class construction process than is currently "
"possible. Currently, the metaclass mechanism is essentially a post-"
"processing step. With the advent of class decorators, much of these post-"
"processing chores can be taken over by the decorator mechanism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:34
msgid ""
"In particular, there is an important body of use cases where it would be "
"useful to preserve the order in which a class members are declared. "
"Ordinary Python objects store their members in a dictionary, in which "
"ordering is unimportant, and members are accessed strictly by name. "
"However, Python is often used to interface with external systems in which"
" the members are organized according to an implicit ordering. Examples "
"include declaration of C structs; COM objects; Automatic translation of "
"Python classes into IDL or database schemas, such as used in an ORM; and "
"so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:44
msgid ""
"In such cases, it would be useful for a Python programmer to specify such"
" ordering directly using the declaration order of class members. "
"Currently, such orderings must be specified explicitly, using some other "
"mechanism (see the ctypes module for an example.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:49
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, the current method for declaring a metaclass does not "
"allow for this, since the ordering information has already been lost by "
"the time the metaclass comes into play. By allowing the metaclass to get "
"involved in the class construction process earlier, the new system allows"
" the ordering or other early artifacts of construction to be preserved "
"and examined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:56
msgid ""
"There proposed metaclass mechanism also supports a number of other "
"interesting use cases beyond preserving the ordering of declarations. One"
" use case is to insert symbols into the namespace of the class body which"
" are only valid during class construction. An example of this might be "
"\"field constructors\", small functions that are used in the creation of "
"class members. Another interesting possibility is supporting forward "
"references, i.e. references to Python symbols that are declared further "
"down in the class body."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:65
msgid ""
"The other, weaker, rationale is purely cosmetic: The current method for "
"specifying a metaclass is by assignment to the special variable "
"``__metaclass__``, which is considered by some to be aesthetically less "
"than ideal. Others disagree strongly with that opinion. This PEP will not"
" address this issue, other than to note it, since aesthetic debates "
"cannot be resolved via logical proofs."

msgid ""
"In the current metaclass system, the metaclass object can be any callable"
" type. This does not change, however in order to fully exploit all of the"
" new features the metaclass will need to have an extra attribute which is"
" used during class pre-construction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:109
msgid ""
"This attribute is named ``__prepare__``, which is invoked as a function "

"The example above illustrates how the arguments to 'class' are "

"be one or more keyword arguments, one of which can be *metaclass*. Note "
"that the *metaclass* argument is not included in *kwargs*, since it is "
"filtered out by the normal parameter assignment algorithm. (Note also "
"that *metaclass* is a keyword-only argument as per :pep:`3102`.)"

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:147
msgid ""
"``__prepare__`` returns a dictionary-like object which is used to store "
"the class member definitions during evaluation of the class body. In "
"other words, the class body is evaluated as a function block (just like "
"it is now), except that the local variables dictionary is replaced by the"
" dictionary returned from ``__prepare__``. This dictionary object can be "
"a regular dictionary or a custom mapping type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:155
msgid ""
"This dictionary-like object is not required to support the full "
"dictionary interface. A dictionary which supports a limited set of "
"dictionary operations will restrict what kinds of actions can occur "
"during evaluation of the class body. A minimal implementation might only "
"support adding and retrieving values from the dictionary - most class "
"bodies will do no more than that during evaluation. For some classes, it "
"may be desirable to support deletion as well. Many metaclasses will need "
"to make a copy of this dictionary afterwards, so iteration or other means"
" for reading out the dictionary contents may also be useful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:166
msgid ""
"The ``__prepare__`` method will most often be implemented as a class "
"method rather than an instance method because it is called before the "
"metaclass instance (i.e. the class itself) is created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:170
msgid ""
"Once the class body has finished evaluating, the metaclass will be called"
" (as a callable) with the class dictionary, which is no different from "
"the current metaclass mechanism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:174
msgid ""
"Typically, a metaclass will create a custom dictionary - either a "
"subclass of dict, or a wrapper around it - that will contain additional "
"properties that are set either before or during the evaluation of the "
"class body. Then in the second phase, the metaclass can use these "
"additional properties to further customize the class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:181
msgid ""
"An example would be a metaclass that uses information about the ordering "
"of member declarations to create a C struct. The metaclass would provide "
"a custom dictionary that simply keeps a record of the order of "
"insertions. This does not need to be a full 'ordered dict' "
"implementation, but rather just a Python list of (key,value) pairs that "
"is appended to for each insertion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:188
msgid ""
"Note that in such a case, the metaclass would be required to deal with "
"the possibility of duplicate keys, but in most cases that is trivial. The"
" metaclass can use the first declaration, the last, combine them in some "
"fashion, or simply throw an exception. It's up to the metaclass to decide"
" how it wants to handle that case."

msgid ""
"Josiah Carlson proposed using the name 'type' instead of 'metaclass', on "
"the theory that what is really being specified is the type of the type. "
"While this is technically correct, it is also confusing from the point of"
" view of a programmer creating a new class. From the application "
"programmer's point of view, the 'type' that they are interested in is the"
" class that they are writing; the type of that type is the metaclass."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:262
msgid ""
"There were some objections in the discussion to the 'two-phase' creation "
"process, where the metaclass is invoked twice, once to create the class "
"dictionary and once to 'finish' the class. Some people felt that these "
"two phases should be completely separate, in that there ought to be "
"separate syntax for specifying the custom dict as for specifying the "
"metaclass. However, in most cases, the two will be intimately tied "
"together, and the metaclass will most likely have an intimate knowledge "
"of the internal details of the class dict. Requiring the programmer to "
"insure that the correct dict type and the correct metaclass type are used"
" together creates an additional and unneeded burden on the programmer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3115.rst:274
msgid ""
"Another good suggestion was to simply use an ordered dict for all "
"classes, and skip the whole 'custom dict' mechanism. This was based on "
"the observation that most use cases for a custom dict were for the "
"purposes of preserving order information. However, this idea has several "
"drawbacks, first because it means that an ordered dict implementation "
"would have to be added to the set of built-in types in Python, and second"
" because it would impose a slight speed (and complexity) penalty on all "
"class declarations. Later, several people came up with ideas for use "
"cases for custom dictionaries other than preserving field orderings, so "
"this idea was dropped."
