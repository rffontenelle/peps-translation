msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0633.rst:19
msgid ""
"This PEP has been rejected in favour of :pep:`631` due to its popularity,"

msgid ""
"This PEP specifies how to write a project's dependencies in a "

#: ../../peps/pep-0633.rst:36
msgid ""
"There are multiple benefits to using TOML tables and other data-types to "

msgid "Rationale"

msgid ""
"Most of this is taken from discussions in the `PEP 621 dependencies "
"topic`_. This has elements from `Pipfile`_, `Poetry`_, `Dart's "
