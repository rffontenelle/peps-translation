"The process of including a new module into the Python standard library is"
" hindered by the API lock-in and promise of backward compatibility "
"implied by a module being formally part of Python.  This PEP proposes a "
"transitional state for modules - inclusion in a special ``__preview__`` "
"package for the duration of a minor release (roughly 18 months) prior to "
"full acceptance into the standard library.  On one hand, this state "
"provides the module with the benefits of being formally part of the "
"Python distribution.  On the other hand, the core development team "
"explicitly states that no promises are made with regards to the module's "
"eventual full inclusion into the standard library, or to the stability of"
" its API, which may change for the next release."

"We expect most modules proposed for addition into the Python standard "

msgid ""
"It is important to stress that the aim of this proposal is not to make "
"the process of adding new modules to the standard library more difficult."
"  On the contrary, it tries to provide a means to add *more* useful "
"libraries.  Modules which are obvious candidates for entry can be added "
"as before.  Modules which due to uncertainties about the API could be "
"stalled for a long time now have a means to still be distributed with "

"Currently, the core developers are really reluctant to add new interfaces"

"By gating all major API additions through some kind of a preview "

"We can also start integrating preview modules with the rest of the "
"standard library early, so long as we make it clear to packagers that the"

"opposite of what is intended for the preview package - it is almost "
"certain that all names added to the preview will be removed at some "
"point, most likely due to their being moved to a permanent home in the "

"3.X will either graduate to the normal standard library namespace in "
