"Since the first draft of this PEP, Guido wrote :pep:`343` as a simplified"

"exact same semantics for the new statements as this PEP, but uses a "
"slightly different mechanism to allow generators to be used to write "
"statement templates.  However, Guido has indicated that he intends to "
"accept a new PEP being written by Raymond Hettinger that will integrate "
":pep:`288` and :pep:`325`, and will permit a generator decorator like the"
" one described in this PEP to be used to write statement templates for "
"PEP 343. The other difference was the choice of keyword ('with' versus "
"'do') and Guido has stated he will organise a vote on that in the context"

"This PEP proposes that Python's ability to reliably manage resources be "
"enhanced by the introduction of a new ``with`` statement that allows "
"factoring out of arbitrary ``try``/``finally`` and some "

"'user defined statement', and the associated class definitions are called"
" 'statement templates'."

"The above is the main point of the PEP.  However, if that was all it "

"essentially redundant. Instead, this PEP recommends additional "
"enhancements that make it natural to write these statement templates "
"using appropriately decorated generators.  A side effect of those "

"management of resources inside generators."

"This is quite similar to :pep:`343`, but the exceptions that occur are "
