"Historically, Python uses the ANSI APIs for interacting with the Windows "

" long discouraged in favor of the UTF-16 APIs. Within the operating "
"system, all text is represented as UTF-16, and the ANSI APIs perform "

"This PEP proposes changing the default filesystem encoding on Windows to "

"to correctly round-trip all valid paths in Windows filesystems. "

"File system paths are almost universally represented as text with an "

"option (the \"active code page\") and these APIs (the \"\\*A functions\")"

"Currently the default filesystem encoding is 'mbcs', which is a meta-"

"representation is). When Python code requests paths as ``bytes``, the "
