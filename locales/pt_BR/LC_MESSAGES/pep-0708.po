msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:64
msgid ""
"There is a long-standing class of attacks that are called \"dependency "
"confusion\" attacks, which roughly boil down to an individual user "
"expected to get package ``A``, but instead they got ``B``. In Python, "
"this almost always happens due to the configuration of multiple "
"repositories (possibly including the default of PyPI), where they "
"expected package ``A`` to come from repository ``X``, but someone is able"
" to publish package ``B`` to repository ``Y`` under the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:72
msgid ""
"Dependency Confusion attacks have long been possible, but they've "
"recently gained press with `public examples of cases where these attacks "
"were successfully executed <https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-"
"confusion-4a5d60fec610>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:76
msgid ""
"A specific example of this is the recent case where the PyTorch project "
"had an internal package named ``torchtriton`` which was only ever "
"intended to be installed from their repositories located at "
"``https://download.pytorch.org/``, but that repository was designed to be"
" used in conjunction with PyPI, and the name of ``torchtriton`` was not "
"claimed on PyPI, which allowed the attacker to use that name and publish "
"a malicious version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:83
msgid ""
"There are a number of ways to mitigate against these attacks today, but "
"they all require that the end user go out of their way to protect "
"themselves, rather than being protected by default. This means that for "
"the vast bulk of users, they are likely to remain vulnerable, even if "
"they are ultimately aware of these types of attacks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:89
msgid ""
"Ultimately the underlying cause of these attacks come from the fact that "
"there is no globally unique namespace that all Python package names come "
"from. Instead, each repository is its own distinct namespace, and when "
"given an \"abstract\" name such as ``spam`` to install, an installer has "
"to implicitly turn that into a \"concrete\" name such as "
"``pypi.org:spam`` or ``example.com:spam``. Currently the standard "
"behavior in Python installation tools is to implicitly flatten these "
"multiple namespaces into one that contains the files from all namespaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:98
msgid ""
"This assumption that collapsing the namespaces is what was expected means"
" that when packages with the same name in different repositories are "
"authored by different parties (such as in the ``torchtriton`` case) "
"dependency confusion attacks become possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:103
msgid ""
"This is made particularly tricky in that there is no \"right\" answer; "
"there are valid use cases both for wanting two repositories merged into "
"one namespace *and* for wanting two repositories to be treated as "
"distinct namespaces. This means that an installer needs some mechanism by"
" which to determine when it should merge the namespaces of multiple "
"repositories and when it should not, rather than a blanket always merge "
"or never merge rule."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:110
msgid ""
"This functionality could be pushed directly to the end user, since "
"ultimately the end user is the person whose expectations of what gets "
"installed from what repository actually matters. However, by extending "
"the repository specification to allow a repository to indicate when it is"
" safe, we can enable individual projects and repositories to \"work by "
"default\", even when their project naturally spans multiple distinct "
"namespaces, while maintaining the ability for an installer to be secure "
"by default."

"On its own, this PEP does not solve dependency confusion attacks, but "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:127
msgid ""
"There are two broad use cases for merging names across repositories that "
"this PEP seeks to enable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:130
msgid ""
"The first use case is when one repository is not defining its own names, "
"but rather is extending names defined in other repositories. This "
"commonly happens in cases where a project is being mirrored from one "
"repository to another (see `Bandersnatch "
"<https://pypi.org/project/bandersnatch/>`__) or when a repository is "
"providing supplementary artifacts for a specific platform (see `Piwheels "
"<https://www.piwheels.org/>`__)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:137
msgid ""
"In this case neither the repositories nor the projects that are being "
"extended may have any knowledge that they are being extended or by whom, "
"so this cannot rely on any information that isn't present in the "
"\"extending\" repository itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:141
msgid ""
"The second use case is when the project wants to publish to one \"main\" "
"repository, but then have additional repositories that provide binaries "
"for additional platforms, GPUs, CPUs, etc. Currently wheel tags are not "
"sufficiently able to express these types of binary compatibility, so "
"projects that wish to rely on them are forced to set up multiple "
"repositories and have their users manually configure them to get the "
"correct binaries for their platform, GPU, CPU, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:149
msgid ""
"This use case is similar to the first, but the important difference that "
"makes it a distinct use case on it's own is who is providing the "
"information and what their level of trust is."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:153
msgid ""
"When a user configures a specific repository (or relies on the default) "
"there is no ambiguity as to what repository they mean. A repository is "
"identified by an URL, and through the domain system, URLs are globally "
"unique identifiers. This lack of ambiguity means that an installer can "
"assume that the repository operator is trustworthy and can trust metadata"
" that they provide without needing to validate it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:160
msgid ""
"On the flip side, given an installer finds a name in multiple "
"repositories it is ambiguous which of them the installer should trust. "
"This ambiguity means that an installer cannot assume that the project "
"owner on either repository is trustworthy and needs to validate that they"
" are indeed the same project and that one isn't a dependency confusion "
"attack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0708.rst:166
msgid ""
"Without some way for the installer to validate the metadata between "
"multiple repositories, projects would be forced into becoming repository "
"operators to safely support this use case. That wouldn't be a "
"particularly wrong choice to make; however, there is a danger that if we "
"don't provide a way for repositories to let project owners express this "
"relationship safely, they will be incentivized to let them use the "
"repository operator's metadata instead which would reintroduce the "
"original insecurity."
