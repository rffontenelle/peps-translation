#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:39
msgid ""
"One of the advantages of Python's exception handling philosophy is that "
"it makes it harder to do the \"wrong\" thing (e.g. failing to check the "
"return value of some system call).  Currently, this does not apply to "
"resource cleanup.  The current syntax for acquisition and release of a "
"resource (for example, a lock) is::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:51
msgid ""
"This syntax separates the acquisition and release by a (possibly large) "
"block of code, which makes it difficult to confirm \"at a glance\" that "
"the code manages the resource correctly.  Another common error is to code"
" the \"acquire\" call within the try block, which incorrectly releases "
"the lock if the acquire fails."

"This statement is defined as being equivalent to the following sequence "
"of statements::"
msgstr ""

"(The presence of an ``__exit__`` method is *not* checked like that of "
"``__enter__`` to ensure that using inappropriate objects in with: "
"statements gives an error)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:91
msgid ""
"A number of potential extensions to the basic syntax have been discussed "
"on the Python Developers list.  None of these extensions are included in "
"the solution proposed by this PEP.  In many cases, the arguments are "
"nearly equally strong in both directions.  In such cases, the PEP has "
"always chosen simplicity, simply because where extra power is needed, the"
" existing try block is available."

msgid "Multiple expressions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:101
msgid ""
"One proposal was for allowing multiple expressions within one 'with' "
"statement.  The ``__enter__`` methods would be called left to right, and "
"the ``__exit__`` methods right to left.  The advantage of doing so is "
"that where more than one resource is being managed, nested 'with' "
"statements will result in code drifting towards the right margin.  The "
"solution to this problem is the same as for any other deep nesting - "
"factor out some of the code into a separate function.  Furthermore, the "
"question of what happens if one of the ``__exit__`` methods raises an "
"exception (should the other ``__exit__`` methods be called?) needs to be "
"addressed."

msgid "Exception handling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:115
msgid ""
"An extension to the protocol to include an optional ``__except__`` "
"handler, which is called when an exception is raised, and which can "
"handle or re-raise the exception, has been suggested.  It is not at all "
"clear that the semantics of this extension can be made precise and "
"understandable.  For example, should the equivalent code be ``try ... "
"except ... else`` if an exception handler is defined, and ``try ... "
"finally`` if not?  How can this be determined at compile time, in "
"general?  The alternative is to define the code as expanding to a ``try "
"... except`` inside a ``try ... finally``. But this may not do the right "
"thing in real life."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:126
msgid ""
"The only use case identified for exception handling is with transactional"
" processing (commit on a clean finish, and rollback on an exception).  "
"This is probably just as easy to handle with a conventional ``try ... "
"except ... else`` block, and so the PEP does not include any support for "
"exception handlers."

msgid "Implementation Notes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:136
msgid ""
"There is a potential race condition in the code specified as equivalent "
"to the with statement.  For example, if a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` exception"
" is raised between the completion of the ``__enter__`` method call and "
"the start of the try block, the ``__exit__`` method will not be called.  "
"This can lead to resource leaks, or to deadlocks.  [XXX Guido has stated "
"that he cares about this sort of race condition, and intends to write "
"some C magic to handle them.  The implementation of the 'with' statement "
"should copy this.]"

msgid ""
"Should existing classes (for example, file-like objects and locks) gain "
"appropriate ``__enter__`` and ``__exit__`` methods?  The obvious reason "
"in favour is convenience (no adapter needed).  The argument against is "
"that if built-in files have this but (say) ``StringIO`` does not, then "
"code that uses \"with\" on a file object can't be reused with a "
"``StringIO`` object.  So ``__exit__ = close`` becomes a part of the "
"\"file-like object\" protocol, which user-defined classes may need to "
"support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:159
msgid ""
"The ``__enter__`` hook may be unnecessary - for many use cases, an "
"adapter class is needed and in that case, the work done by the "
"``__enter__`` hook can just as easily be done in the ``__init__`` hook."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0310.rst:163
msgid ""
"If a way of controlling object lifetimes explicitly was available, the "
"function of the ``__exit__`` hook could be taken over by the existing "
"``__del__`` hook.  An email exchange [1]_ with a proponent of this "
"approach left one of the authors even more convinced that it isn't the "
"right idea..."

msgid ""
"It has been suggested [2]_ that the \"__exit__\" method be called "
"\"close\", or that a \"close\" method should be considered if no "
"``__exit__`` method is found, to increase the \"out-of-the-box utility\" "
"of the \"with ...\" construct."
msgstr ""

"There are some similarities in concept between 'with ...' blocks and "

"the with block functionality [3]_.  While neat on some levels, we think "
