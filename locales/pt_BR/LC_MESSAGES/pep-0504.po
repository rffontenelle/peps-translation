"Writing secure software under deadline and budget pressures is a hard "

"involving personally identifiable information [#breaches]_, as well as "
"with failures to take security considerations into account when new "
"systems, like motor vehicles [#uconnect]_, are connected to the internet."
" It's also the case that a lot of the programming advice readily "
"available on the internet [#search] simply doesn't take the mathematical "
"arcana of computer security into account. Compounding these issues is the"
" fact that defenders have to cover *all* of their potential "
"vulnerabilities, as a single mistake can make it possible to subvert "
"other defences [#bcrypt]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0504.rst:189
msgid ""
"One of the factors that contributes to making this last aspect "
"particularly difficult is APIs where using them inappropriately creates a"
" *silent* security failure - one where the only way to find out that what"
" you're doing is incorrect is for someone reviewing your code to say "
"\"that's a potential security problem\", or for a system you're "
"responsible for to be compromised through such an oversight (and you're "
"not only still responsible for that system when it is compromised, but "
"your intrusion detection and auditing mechanisms are good enough for you "

"As the designers of one of the world's most popular languages "

"The problem is that \"deterministic\" on its own doesn't convey those "

"\"ensure_repeatable\" aims to address both of those problems, as its "
