"CPython's Limited C-API and Stable ABI, introduced in :pep:`384`, will be"

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:26
msgid ""
":pep:`384` defined a Limited API and Stable ABI, which allow extenders "
"and embedders of CPython to compile extension modules that are binary-"
"compatible with any subsequent version of 3.x. In theory, this brings "
"several advantages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:31
msgid ""
"A module can be built only once per platform and support multiple "
"versions of Python, reducing time, power and maintainer attention needed "
"for builds (in exchange for potentially worse performance)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:35
msgid ""
"Binary wheels using the Stable ABI work with new versions of CPython "
"throughout the pre-release period, and can be tested in environments "
"where building from source is not practical."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:39
msgid ""
"As a welcome side effect of the Limited API's hiding of implementation "
"details, this API is becoming a viable target for alternate Python "
"implementations that would be incompatible with the full C API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:43
msgid ""
"However, in hindsight, :pep:`384` and its implementation has several "
"issues:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:45
msgid ""
"It is ill-defined. According to :pep:`384`, functions are *opt-out*: all "
"functions not specially marked are part of the Stable ABI. In practice, "
"for Windows there's a list that's *opt-in*. For users there is a "
"``#define`` that should make only the Stable ABI available, but there is "
"no process that ensures it is kept up-to date. Neither is there a process"
" for updating the documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:51
msgid ""
"Until recently, the Stable ABI was not tested at all. It tends to break. "
"For example, changing a function to a macro can break the Stable ABI as "
"the function symbol is removed."

msgid "There is no way to deprecate parts of the Limited API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:55

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:66
msgid ""
"This PEP contains a lot of clarifications and definitions, but just one "
"big technical change: the Stable ABI will be explicitly listed in a "
"human-maintained “manifest” file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:70
msgid ""
"There have been efforts to collect such lists automatically, e.g. by "
"scanning the symbols exported from Python. Such automation might seem "
"easier to maintain than a handcrafted file, but has major issues: for "
"example, the set exported symbols has platform-specific variations. Also,"
" the cost of updating an explicit manifest is small compared to the "
"overall work that should go into changing API that will need to be "
"supported forever (or until Python 3 reaches end of life, if that comes "
"sooner)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:80
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes automatically generating things *from* the manifest: "
"initially documentation and DLL contents, with later possibilities for "
"also automating tests."

":pep:`384` and this document deal with the *Limited API* and the *Stable "
"ABI*, two related but distinct concepts. In short:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:91
msgid ""
"The *Stable ABI* is a promise that certain extensions compiled with "
"CPython 3.x will be binary compatible with all subsequent versions of "
"CPython 3.x."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:94
msgid ""
"The *Limited API* is a subset of CPython's C API that produces such "
"extensions."

"This section clarifies these terms and defines some of their semantics "
"(either pre-existing or newly proposed here)."

"specific Stable ABI version will be compatible with any newer interpreter"
" of the same major version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:110
msgid ""
"The Stable ABI does not define a complete binary interface: important "
"details like the layout of structures in memory or function calling "
"conventions are determined by the platform and the compiler and its "
"settings. The Stable ABI promise only applies if these lower-details are "
"also stable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:116
msgid ""
"For example, an extension built with the CPython 3.10 Stable ABI will be "
"usable with CPython 3.11, 3.12, etc. It will not necessarily be "
"compatible with CPython 4.0, nor with CPython 3.10 on a different "
"platform."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:121
msgid ""
"The Stable ABI is not generally forward-compatible: an extension built "
"and tested with CPython 3.10 will not generally be compatible with "
"CPython 3.9."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:125
msgid ""
"For example, starting in Python 3.10, the ``Py_tp_doc`` slot may be set "

"the interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:129
msgid ""
"The Stable ABI trades performance for its stability. For example, "
"extensions built for a specific CPython version will automatically use "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:144
msgid ""
"Extensions that target the Limited API should define the preprocessor "
"macro ``Py_LIMITED_API`` to either ``3`` or the current "

"the macro is not perfect: due to technical issues or oversights, some "

msgstr ""

"The Limited API is not guaranteed to be *stable*. In the future, parts of"

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:159
msgid ""
"For example, a function declaration might be removed from public header "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0652.rst:164
msgid ""
"The goal for the Limited API is to cover everything needed to interact "
"with the interpreter. The main reason to not include a public API in the "
