"File names, environment variables, and command line arguments are defined as "
"being character data in POSIX; the C APIs however allow passing arbitrary "
"bytes - whether these conform to a certain encoding or not. This PEP "
"proposes a means of dealing with such irregularities by embedding the bytes "
"in character strings in such a way that allows recreation of the original "
"byte string."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:24
msgid ""
"The C char type is a data type that is commonly used to represent both "
"character data and bytes. Certain POSIX interfaces are specified and widely "
"understood as operating on character data, however, the system call "
"interfaces make no assumption on the encoding of these data, and pass them "
"on as-is. With Python 3, character strings use a Unicode-based internal "
"representation, making it difficult to ignore the encoding of byte strings "
"in the same way that the C interfaces can ignore the encoding."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:33
msgid ""
"On the other hand, Microsoft Windows NT has corrected the original design "
"limitation of Unix, and made it explicit in its system interfaces that these "
"data (file names, environment variables, command line arguments) are indeed "
"character data, by providing a Unicode-based API (keeping a C-char-based one "
"for backwards compatibility)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:40
msgid ""
"For Python 3, one proposed solution is to provide two sets of APIs: a byte-"
"oriented one, and a character-oriented one, where the character-oriented one "
"would be limited to not being able to represent all data accurately. "
"Unfortunately, for Windows, the situation would be exactly the opposite: the "
"byte-oriented interface cannot represent all data; only the character-"
"oriented API can. As a consequence, libraries and applications that want to "
"support all user data in a cross-platform manner have to accept mish-mash of "
"bytes and characters exactly in the way that caused endless troubles for "
"Python 2.x."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:50
msgid ""
"With this PEP, a uniform treatment of these data as characters becomes "
"possible. The uniformity is achieved by using specific encoding algorithms, "
"meaning that the data can be converted back to bytes on POSIX systems only "
"if the same encoding is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:55
msgid ""
"Being able to treat such strings uniformly will allow application writers to "
"abstract from details specific to the operating system, and reduces the risk "
"of one API failing when the other API would have worked."

msgid "Specification"

msgid ""
"On Windows, Python uses the wide character APIs to access character-oriented "
"APIs, allowing direct conversion of the environmental data to Python str "
"objects (:pep:`277`)."

msgid ""
"On POSIX systems, Python currently applies the locale's encoding to convert "
"the byte data to Unicode, failing for characters that cannot be decoded. "
"With this PEP, non-decodable bytes >= 128 will be represented as lone "
"surrogate codes U+DC80..U+DCFF. Bytes below 128 will produce exceptions; see "
"the discussion below."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:73
msgid ""
"To convert non-decodable bytes, a new error handler (:pep:`293`) "
"\"surrogateescape\" is introduced, which produces these surrogates. On "
"encoding, the error handler converts the surrogate back to the corresponding "
"byte. This error handler will be used in any API that receives or produces "
"file names, command line arguments, or environment variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0383.txt:80
msgid ""
"The error handler interface is extended to allow the encode error handler to "
"return byte strings immediately, in addition to returning Unicode strings "
"which then get encoded again (also see the discussion below)."

"UTF-8b [3]_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While providing a uniform API to non-decodable bytes, this interface has the "
"limitation that chosen representation only \"works\" if the data get "
"converted back to bytes with the surrogateescape error handler also. "
"Encoding the data with the locale's encoding and the (default) strict error "
"handler will raise an exception, encoding them with UTF-8 will produce non-"
"sensical data."

"This PEP allows the possibility of \"smuggling\" bytes in character strings. "
"This would be a security risk if the bytes are security-critical when "
"interpreted as characters on a target system, such as path name separators. "
"For this reason, the PEP rejects smuggling bytes below 128. If the target "
"system uses EBCDIC, such smuggled bytes may still be a security risk, "
"allowing smuggling of e.g. square brackets or the backslash. Python "
"currently does not support EBCDIC, so this should not be a problem in "
"practice. Anybody porting Python to an EBCDIC system might want to adjust "
"the error handlers, or come up with other approaches to address the security "
"risks."

"Encodings that are not compatible with ASCII are not supported by this "
"specification; bytes in the ASCII range that fail to decode will cause an "
"exception. It is widely agreed that such encodings should not be used as "
"locale charsets."

msgid ""
"For most applications, we assume that they eventually pass data received "
"from a system interface back into the same system interfaces. For example, "
"an application invoking os.listdir() will likely pass the result strings "
"back into APIs like os.stat() or open(), which then encodes them back into "
"their original byte representation. Applications that need to process the "
"original byte strings can obtain them by encoding the character strings with "
"the file system encoding, passing \"surrogateescape\" as the error handler "
"name. For example, a function that works like os.listdir, except for "
"accepting and returning bytes, would be written as::"

#: ../pep-0383.txt:143
msgid ""
"The extension to the encode error handler interface proposed by this PEP is "
"necessary to implement the 'surrogateescape' error handler, because there "
"are required byte sequences which cannot be generated from replacement "
"Unicode.  However, the encode error handler interface presently requires "
"replacement Unicode to be provided in lieu of the non-encodable Unicode from "
"the source string.  Then it promptly encodes that replacement Unicode.  In "
"some error handlers, such as the 'surrogateescape' proposed here, it is also "
"simpler and more efficient for the error handler to provide a pre-encoded "
"replacement byte string, rather than forcing it to calculating Unicode from "
"which the encoder would create the desired bytes."

"Of these proposals, the approach of escaping each byte XX with the sequence "
"U+0000 U+00XX has the disadvantage that encoding to UTF-8 will introduce a "
"NUL byte in the UTF-8 sequence. As a consequence, C libraries may interpret "
"this as a string termination, even though the string continues. In "
"particular, the gtk libraries will truncate text in this case; other "
"libraries may show similar problems."
