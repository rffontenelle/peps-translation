"File names, environment variables, and command line arguments are defined"
" as being character data in POSIX; the C APIs however allow passing "
"arbitrary bytes - whether these conform to a certain encoding or not. "
"This PEP proposes a means of dealing with such irregularities by "
"embedding the bytes in character strings in such a way that allows "
"recreation of the original byte string."

#: ../../peps/pep-0383.rst:24
msgid ""
"The C char type is a data type that is commonly used to represent both "
"character data and bytes. Certain POSIX interfaces are specified and "
"widely understood as operating on character data, however, the system "
"call interfaces make no assumption on the encoding of these data, and "
"pass them on as-is. With Python 3, character strings use a Unicode-based "
"internal representation, making it difficult to ignore the encoding of "
"byte strings in the same way that the C interfaces can ignore the "
"encoding."

"On the other hand, Microsoft Windows NT has corrected the original design"
" limitation of Unix, and made it explicit in its system interfaces that "
"these data (file names, environment variables, command line arguments) "
"are indeed character data, by providing a Unicode-based API (keeping a C"
"-char-based one for backwards compatibility)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0383.rst:40
msgid ""
"For Python 3, one proposed solution is to provide two sets of APIs: a "
"byte-oriented one, and a character-oriented one, where the character-"
"oriented one would be limited to not being able to represent all data "
"accurately. Unfortunately, for Windows, the situation would be exactly "
"the opposite: the byte-oriented interface cannot represent all data; only"
" the character-oriented API can. As a consequence, libraries and "
"applications that want to support all user data in a cross-platform "
"manner have to accept mish-mash of bytes and characters exactly in the "
"way that caused endless troubles for Python 2.x."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0383.rst:50
msgid ""
"With this PEP, a uniform treatment of these data as characters becomes "
"possible. The uniformity is achieved by using specific encoding "
"algorithms, meaning that the data can be converted back to bytes on POSIX"
" systems only if the same encoding is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0383.rst:55
msgid ""
"Being able to treat such strings uniformly will allow application writers"
" to abstract from details specific to the operating system, and reduces "
"the risk of one API failing when the other API would have worked."

"On POSIX systems, Python currently applies the locale's encoding to "
"convert the byte data to Unicode, failing for characters that cannot be "
"decoded. With this PEP, non-decodable bytes >= 128 will be represented as"
" lone surrogate codes U+DC80..U+DCFF. Bytes below 128 will produce "
"exceptions; see the discussion below."

"To convert non-decodable bytes, a new error handler (:pep:`293`) "
"\"surrogateescape\" is introduced, which produces these surrogates. On "
"encoding, the error handler converts the surrogate back to the "
"corresponding byte. This error handler will be used in any API that "
"receives or produces file names, command line arguments, or environment "
"variables."

"This PEP allows the possibility of \"smuggling\" bytes in character "
"strings. This would be a security risk if the bytes are security-critical"
" when interpreted as characters on a target system, such as path name "
"separators. For this reason, the PEP rejects smuggling bytes below 128. "
"If the target system uses EBCDIC, such smuggled bytes may still be a "
"security risk, allowing smuggling of e.g. square brackets or the "
"backslash. Python currently does not support EBCDIC, so this should not "
"be a problem in practice. Anybody porting Python to an EBCDIC system "
"might want to adjust the error handlers, or come up with other approaches"

"For most applications, we assume that they eventually pass data received "
"from a system interface back into the same system interfaces. For "
"example, an application invoking os.listdir() will likely pass the result"
" strings back into APIs like os.stat() or open(), which then encodes them"
" back into their original byte representation. Applications that need to "
"process the original byte strings can obtain them by encoding the "
"character strings with the file system encoding, passing "
"\"surrogateescape\" as the error handler name. For example, a function "
"that works like os.listdir, except for accepting and returning bytes, "
"would be written as::"

"The extension to the encode error handler interface proposed by this PEP "
"is necessary to implement the 'surrogateescape' error handler, because "
"there are required byte sequences which cannot be generated from "
"replacement Unicode.  However, the encode error handler interface "
"presently requires replacement Unicode to be provided in lieu of the non-"
"encodable Unicode from the source string.  Then it promptly encodes that "
"replacement Unicode.  In some error handlers, such as the "
"'surrogateescape' proposed here, it is also simpler and more efficient "
"for the error handler to provide a pre-encoded replacement byte string, "
"rather than forcing it to calculating Unicode from which the encoder "
"would create the desired bytes."

"Of these proposals, the approach of escaping each byte XX with the "
"sequence U+0000 U+00XX has the disadvantage that encoding to UTF-8 will "
"introduce a NUL byte in the UTF-8 sequence. As a consequence, C libraries"
" may interpret this as a string termination, even though the string "
"continues. In particular, the gtk libraries will truncate text in this "
"case; other libraries may show similar problems."
