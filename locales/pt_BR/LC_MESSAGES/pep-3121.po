"Extension module initialization currently has a few deficiencies. There "

"conflicts, the entry functions don't follow the usual calling convention,"

"Currently, extension modules are initialized usually once and then "
"\"live\" forever. The only exception is when Py_Finalize() is called: "
"then the initialization routine is invoked a second time. This is bad "
"from a resource management point of view: memory and other resources "
"might get allocated each time initialization is called, but there is no "
"way to reclaim them. As a result, there is currently no way to completely"
" release all resources Python has allocated."
