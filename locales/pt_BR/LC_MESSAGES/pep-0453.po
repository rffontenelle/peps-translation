"If a project simply assumes a user already has the tooling then beginning "

"global hook that looks for commands that don't exist and suggest an OS "

"systems with platform package managers that include a package that provides "
"the relevant cross-platform installer command (such as many major Linux "

"users, or more conservative Linux distributions. The challenges of dealing "
"with this problem for beginners (who are often also completely new to "

"If a project chooses to duplicate the installation instructions and tell "

"user experience created by this approach still isn't particularly good "
"(although there is an effort under way to create a combined Windows "

"The projects that have decided to forgo dependencies altogether are forced "

"By officially recommending and providing by default a specific cross-"

"appropriate installation tools available (or access to clear instructions on "
"how to obtain them). This is expected to become more important in the future "
"as the :pep:`Wheel <427>` package format (deliberately) does not have a "

"Reducing the burden of actually installing a third-party package should also "

"As no new packaging standard can achieve widespread adoption without a "

"The broader community has embraced the Python Package Index as a mechanism "

"In addition, the core CPython development team have the luxury of dropping "

"This means that the current ``setup.py install`` based model for package "
"installation poses serious difficulties for the development and adoption of "

msgstr ""

"As an indicator of how this may cause problems for the broader ecosystem, "

"By contrast, using a separate installer application like ``pip`` (which "

"packaging standards in older versions of Python, just by upgrading ``pip`` "
"(which receives new feature releases roughly every 6 months). The situation "

"as many other language specific installers."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0453.txt:189
msgid ""
"For Python 2.6, this compatibility issue is largely limited to various "
"enterprise Linux distributions (and their downstream derivatives). These "
"distributions often have even slower update cycles than CPython, so they "
"offer full support for versions of Python that are considered \"security fix "
"only\" versions upstream (and sometimes may even be to the point where the "
"core development team no longer support them at all - you can still get "
"commercial support for Python 2.3 if you really need it!)."

"In practice, the fact that tools like ``wget`` and ``curl`` are readily "
"available on Linux systems, that most users of Python on Linux are already "
"familiar with the command line, and that most Linux distributions ship with "
"a default configuration that makes running Python scripts easy, means that "
"the existing ``pip`` bootstrapping instructions for any \\*nix system are "
"already quite straightforward. Even if ``pip`` isn't provided by the system "
"package manager, then using ``wget`` or ``curl`` to retrieve the bootstrap "
"script from www.pip-installer.org and then running it is just a couple of "
"shell commands that can easily be copied and pasted as necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0453.txt:207
msgid ""
"Accordingly, for any version of Python on any \\*nix system, the need to "
"bootstrap ``pip`` in older versions isn't considered a major barrier to "
"adoption of new packaging standards, since it's just one more small "
"speedbump encountered by users of these long term stable releases. For "
"\\*nix systems, this PEP's formal endorsement of ``pip`` as the preferred "
"default packaging tool is seen as more important than the underlying "
"technical details involved in making ``pip`` available by default, since it "
"shifts the nature of the conversation between the developers of ``pip`` and "
"downstream repackagers of both ``pip`` and CPython."

"Firstly, and unlike Python 2.6, Python 2.7 is still a fully supported "
"upstream version, and will remain so until the release of Python 2.7.9 "

"the usual \"security fix only\" mode. That means there are at least another "
"19 months where Python 2.7 is a deployment target for Python applications "

"Other tools like ``zc.buildout`` and ``conda`` are more ambitious in their "

":pep:`439`, the predecessor for this PEP, proposes its own solution. Its "
"solution involves shipping a fake ``pip`` command that when executed would "
"implicitly bootstrap and install pip if it does not already exist. This has "
"been rejected because it is too \"magical\". It hides from the end user when "
"exactly the pip command will be installed or that it is being installed at "
"all. It also does not provide any recommendations or considerations towards "
"downstream packagers who wish to manage the globally installed pip through "
"the mechanisms typical for their system."

"Similar to this PEP is the proposal of just including pip in the standard "
"library. This would ensure that Python always includes pip and fixes all of "
"the end user facing problems with not having pip present by default. This "
"has been rejected because we've learned, through the inclusion and history "
"of ``distutils`` in the standard library, that losing the ability to update "
"the packaging tools independently can leave the tooling in a state of "
"constant limbo. Making it unable to ever reasonably evolve in a time frame "
"that actually affects users as any new features will not be available to the "
"general population for *years*."

"There have also been issues in the past with the \"dual maintenance\" "
"problem if a project continues to be maintained externally while *also* "
"having a fork maintained in the standard library. Since external maintenance "
"of ``pip`` will always be needed to support earlier Python versions, the "
"proposed bootstrapping mechanism will becoming the explicit responsibility "
"of the CPython core developers (assisted by the pip developers), while pip "
"issues reported to the CPython tracker will be migrated to the pip issue "
"tracker. There will no doubt still be some user confusion over which tracker "
"to use, but hopefully less than has been seen historically when including "
"complete public copies of third-party projects in the standard library."

"The approach described in this PEP also avoids some technical issues related "
"to handling CPython maintenance updates when pip has been independently "
"updated to a more recent version. The proposed pip-based bootstrapping "
"mechanism handles that automatically, since pip and the system installer "
"never get into a fight about who owns the pip installation (it is always "
"managed through pip, either directly, or indirectly via the ``ensurepip`` "
"bootstrap module)."

"Finally, the separate bootstrapping step means it is also easy to avoid "
