"This PEP has been rejected (in this form).  The proposed path class is "
"the ultimate kitchen sink; but the notion that it's better to implement "
"**all** functionality that uses a path as a method on a single class is "
"an anti-pattern.  (E.g. why not ``open()``?  Or ``execfile()``?) "
"Subclassing from str is a particularly bad idea; many string operations "
"make no sense when applied to a path.  This PEP has lingered, and while "
"the discussion flares up from time to time, it's time to put this PEP out"
" of its misery.  A less far-fetched proposal might be more palatable."

"This PEP describes a new class, ``Path``, to be added to the ``os`` "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0355.rst:40
msgid ""
"The ideas expressed in this PEP are not recent, but have been debated in "
"the Python community for many years.  Many have felt that the API for "
"manipulating file paths as offered in the os.path module is inadequate.  "
"The first proposal for a ``Path`` object was raised by Just van Rossum on"
" python-dev in 2001 [2]_.  In 2003, Jason Orendorff released version 1.0 "
"of the \"path module\" which was the first public implementation that "
"used objects to represent paths [3]_."

"The path module quickly became very popular and numerous attempts were "

"Dealing with filesystem paths is a common task in any programming "
