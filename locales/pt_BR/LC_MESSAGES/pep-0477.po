"This PEP proposes that the ``ensurepip`` module, added to Python 3.4 by "
"PEP 453, be backported to Python 2.7. It also proposes that automatic "
"invocation of ``ensurepip`` be added to the Python 2.7 Windows and OSX "
"installers. However it does **not** propose that automatic invocation be "
"added to the ``Makefile``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0477.rst:30
msgid ""
"Python 2.7 is effectively a LTS release of Python which represents the "
"end of the 2.x series and there is still a very large contingent of users"
" whom are still using Python 2.7 as their primary version. These users, "
"in order to participate in the wider Python ecosystem, must manually "
"attempt to go out and find the correct way to bootstrap the packaging "
"tools."

"It is the opinion of this PEP that making it as easy as possible for end "
"users to participate in the wider Python ecosystem is important for 3 "
"primary reasons:"

msgid ""
"The Python 2.x to 3.x migration has a number of painpoints that are eased"
" by a number of third party modules such as six [#six]_, modernize "
"[#modernize]_, or future [#future]_. However relying on these tools "
"requires that everyone who uses the project have a tool to install these "
"packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0477.rst:44
msgid ""
"In addition to tooling to aid in migration from Python 2.x to 3.x, there "
"are also a number of modules that are *new* in Python 3 for which there "
"are backports available on PyPI. This can also aid in the ability for "
"people to write 2.x and 3.x compatible software as well as enable them to"
" use some of the newer features of Python 3 on Python 2."

"Users also will need a number of tools in order to create python packages"
" that conform to the newer standards that are being proposed. Things like"
" setuptools [#setuptools]_, Wheel [#wheel]_, and twine [#twine]_ are "
"enabling a safer, faster, and more reliable packaging tool chain. These "
"tools can be difficult for people to use if first they must be told how "
"to go out and install the package manager."

"One of Pythons biggest strengths is in the huge ecosystem of libraries "
"and projects that have been built on top of it, most of which are "
"distributed through PyPI. However, in order to benefit from this wide "
"ecosystem meaningfully requires end users, some of which are going to be "
"new, to make a decision on which package manager they should get, how to "
"get it, and then finally actually installing it first."

"Furthermore, alternative implementations of Python are recognizing the "

#: ../../peps/pep-0477.rst:70
msgid ""
":pep:`453` has ``ensurepip`` automatically invoked by default in the "
"``Makefile`` and the Windows and OSX Installers. This allowed it to "
"ensure that, by default, all users would get Python with pip already "
"installed. This PEP however believes that while this is fine for the "
"Python 2.7 Windows and Mac OS X installers it is *not* ok for the Python "
"2.7 ``Makefile`` in general."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0477.rst:76
msgid ""
"The primary consumers of the ``Makefile`` are downstream package managers"
" which distribute Python themselves. These downstream distributors "
"typically do not want pip to be installed via ``ensurepip`` and would "
"prefer that end users install it with their own package manager. Not "
"invoking ``ensurepip`` automatically from the ``Makefile`` would allow "
"these distributors to simply ignore the fact that ``ensurepip`` has been "
"backported and still not end up with pip installed via it."

"The primary consumers of the OSX and Windows installers are end users who"
" are attempting to install Python on their own machine. There is not a "
"package manager available where these users can install pip into their "

"belief of this PEP that installing by default on OSX and Windows is the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0477.rst:101
msgid ""
"Due to its use in the ``venv`` module, downstream distributors cannot "

" has no such module it is explicitly allowed for downstream distributors "
"to patch the ``ensurepip`` module to prevent it from installing anything."

"If a downstream distributor wishes to disable ``ensurepip`` completely in"
