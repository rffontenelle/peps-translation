"When a module is invoked via Python's -m option the module is bound to "

"However, when the above command line invocation is used it is a natural "
"inference to presume that the module is actually imported under its "

"imports that name then it will obtain the same module instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0499.rst:47

"That actuality is that the module was imported only as ``'__main__'``. "

"the ``re`` module then two caches exist leading to wasteful memory use. "
