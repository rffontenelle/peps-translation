msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:25
msgid ""
"In Python there are no real restrictions yet on how a project should "
"manage its versions, and how they should be incremented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:28
msgid ""
"Distutils provides a ``version`` distribution meta-data field but it is "
"freeform and current users, such as PyPI usually consider the latest "
"version pushed as the ``latest`` one, regardless of the expected "
"semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:32
msgid ""
"Distutils will soon extend its capabilities to allow distributions to "
"express a dependency on other distributions through the ``Requires-Dist``"
" metadata field (see :pep:`345`) and it will optionally allow use of that"
" field to restrict the dependency to a set of compatible versions. Notice"
" that this field is replacing ``Requires`` that was expressing "
"dependencies on modules and packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:38
msgid ""
"The ``Requires-Dist`` field will allow a distribution to define a "
"dependency on another package and optionally restrict this dependency to "
"a set of compatible versions, so one may write::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:44
msgid ""
"This means that the distribution requires ``zope.interface`` with a "
"version greater than ``3.5.0``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:47
msgid ""
"This also means that Python projects will need to follow the same "
"convention as the tool that will be used to install them, so they are "
"able to compare versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:51
msgid ""
"That is why this PEP proposes, for the sake of interoperability, a "
"standard schema to express version information and its comparison "
"semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:54
msgid ""
"Furthermore, this will make OS packagers' work easier when repackaging "
"standards compliant distributions, because as of now it can be difficult "

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:62

"It is not in the scope of this PEP to provide a universal versioning "
"schema intended to support all or even most of existing versioning "
"schemas. There will always be competing grammars, either mandated by "
"distro or project policies or by historical reasons that we cannot expect"
" to change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0386.rst:67
msgid ""
"The proposed schema should be able to express the usual versioning "
"semantics, so it's possible to parse any alternative versioning schema "
"and transform it into a compliant one. This is how OS packagers usually "
"deal with the existing version schemas and is a preferable alternative "
"than supporting an arbitrary set of versioning schemas."
msgstr ""

"a significant number of projects need special meaning versions for \"pre-"
"releases\" (such as \"alpha\", \"beta\", \"rc\"), and these have widely "
"used aliases (\"a\" stands for \"alpha\", \"b\" for \"beta\" and \"c\" "
"for \"rc\"). And these pre-release versions make it impossible to use a "
"simple alphanumerical ordering of the version string components. "
