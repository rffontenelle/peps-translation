"Function definitions only allow simple function names to be used, even "
"though functions are assignable first class objects."

#: ../../peps/pep-0542.rst:19
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes adding support for assigning a function to a class or "
"instance attribute directly in the function definition's header by using "
"the dot notation to separate the object from the function's name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0542.rst:24
msgid ""
"Although a similar feature, this PEP does not address general assignment "
"to anything that supports assignment, such as dict keys and list indexes."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0542.rst:31
msgid ""
"Currently if a function needs to be assigned to a class or instance "
"attribute, it requires an additional assignment statement to be made::"

"While this isn't usually an inconvenience, using dot notation to assign "
"directly in the function's header would greatly simplify this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0542.rst:64
msgid ""
"There are multiple reasons to use this functionality over a standard "
"class method, for example when the class is referenced inside the "
"function's header (such as with decorators and typing). This is also "
"useful when an instance requires a callback attribute::"

#: ../../peps/pep-0542.rst:94
msgid ""
"It reads better than the \"unnatural\" way, since you already know at the"
" time of the function definition what it's goig to be used for. It also "
"saves one line of code while removing visual complexity."
