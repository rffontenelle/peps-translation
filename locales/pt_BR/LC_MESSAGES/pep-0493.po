":pep:`476` updated Python's default handling of HTTPS certificates in "

"validating that the certificates received belonged to the server the "

":pep:`476` changed Python's default behaviour to align with expectations "

"To manage these kinds of situations, web browsers provide users with "
"\"click through\" warnings that allow the user to add the server's "

":pep:`476` did attempt to address this question, by covering how to "

"administrators to disable the feature by default in their Standard "
"Operating Environment definition has been determined to be insufficient "
"in at least some cases. The specific case that led to the initial "
"creation of this PEP is the one where a Linux distributor aims to provide"
