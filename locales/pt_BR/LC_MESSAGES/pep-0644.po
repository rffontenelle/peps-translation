"This PEP proposes for CPython’s standard library to support only OpenSSL "

"incompatible forks, and other TLS libraries are dropped."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0644.rst:25
msgid ""
"Python makes use of OpenSSL in ``hashlib``, ``hmac``, and ``ssl`` "
"modules. OpenSSL provides fast implementations of cryptographic "
"primitives and a full TLS stack including handling of X.509 certificates."
" The ``ssl`` module is used by standard library modules like ``urllib`` "
"and 3rd party modules like ``urllib3`` to implement secure variants of "
"internet protocols. ``pip`` uses the ``ssl`` module to securely download "
"packages from PyPI. Any bug in the ``ssl`` module's bindings to OpenSSL "
"can lead to a severe security issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0644.rst:33
msgid ""
"Over time OpenSSL's public API has evolved and changed. Version 1.0.2 "
"introduced new APIs to verify and match hostnames. OpenSSL 1.1.0 made "
"internal structs opaque and introduced new APIs that replace direct "
"access of struct members. Version 3.0.0 will deprecate more APIs due to "
"internal reorganization that moves cryptographic algorithms out of the "
"core and into providers. Forks like LibreSSL and BoringSSL have diverged "
"in different directions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0644.rst:41
msgid ""
"Currently Python versions 3.6 to 3.9 are compatible with OpenSSL 1.0.2, "
"1.1.0, and 1.1.1. For the most part Python also works with LibreSSL >= "
"2.7.1 with some missing features and broken tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0644.rst:45
msgid ""
"Due to limited resources and time it becomes increasingly hard to support"
" multiple versions and forks as well as test and verify correctness. "
"Besides multiple incompatible APIs there are build time flags, "
"distribution-specific patches, and local crypto-policy settings that add "
"to plethora of combinations. On the other hand, the Python core team has "
"only a couple of domain experts who are familiar with TLS and OpenSSL "
"internals and even fewer who are active maintainers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0644.rst:53
msgid ""
"Requiring OpenSSL 1.1.1 would allow us to give the vast majority of users"
" a better experience, reduce our maintenance overhead and thus free "
"resources to implement new features. Users would be able to rely on the "
"presence of new features and consistent behavior, ultimately resulting in"
" a more robust experience."
