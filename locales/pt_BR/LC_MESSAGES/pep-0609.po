"This document describes a governance model for the Python Packaging "

#: ../../peps/pep-0609.rst:27
msgid ""
"The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a collaborative community that "
"maintains and advances many of the relevant projects in Python packaging."
" The software and standards developed through the PyPA are used to "
"package, share, and install Python software and to interact with indexes "
"of downloadable Python software such as `PyPI`_, the Python Package "
"Index."

#: ../../peps/pep-0609.rst:34
msgid ""
"Currently, the PyPA is an informal and loosely defined organization that "
"lacks true authority, and the inclusion of a given project under the PyPA"
" umbrella or the creation of new projects has been done in an ad-hoc, "
"one-off manner. Similarly, individual membership in the PyPA is not well-"
"defined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0609.rst:40
msgid ""
"While this model has more or less worked for the PyPA in the past, it "
"results in an organization which is missing certain features of a stable "
"ecosystem, namely a clear and transparent decision-making process. This "
"PEP seeks to rectify this by defining a governance model for the PyPA."
