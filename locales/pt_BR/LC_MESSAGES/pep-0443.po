msgid ""
"A **generic function** is composed of multiple functions implementing the"

"Python has always provided a variety of built-in and standard-library "

"does not have a standard way for methods to be added to existing generic "

"In addition, it is currently a common anti-pattern for Python code to "
"inspect the types of received arguments, in order to decide what to do "
"with the objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:50
msgid ""
"For example, code may wish to accept either an object of some type, or a "
"sequence of objects of that type. Currently, the \"obvious way\" to do "

"Abstract Base Classes make it easier to discover present behaviour, but "

"The ``pkgutil.simplegeneric`` implementation relied on several forms of "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:196
msgid ""
"When a generic function implementation is registered for an ABC, the "
"dispatch algorithm switches to an extended form of C3 linearization, "
"which includes the relevant ABCs in the MRO of the provided argument. The"
" algorithm inserts ABCs where their functionality is introduced, i.e. "
"``issubclass(cls, abc)`` returns ``True`` for the class itself but "
"returns ``False`` for all its direct base classes. Implicit ABCs for a "
"given class (either registered or inferred from the presence of a special"
" method like ``__len__()``) are inserted directly after the last ABC "
"explicitly listed in the MRO of said class."

"While this mode of operation is significantly slower, all dispatch "

"An early version of the PEP contained a custom approach that was simpler "
"but created a number of edge cases with surprising results [#why-c3]_."

msgid "Usage Patterns"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:290
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes extending behaviour only of functions specifically "
"marked as generic. Just as a base class method may be overridden by a "
"subclass, so too a function may be overloaded to provide custom "
"functionality for a given type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:295
msgid ""
"Universal overloading does not equal *arbitrary* overloading, in the "
"sense that we need not expect people to randomly redefine the behavior of"
" existing functions in unpredictable ways. To the contrary, generic "
"function usage in actual programs tends to follow very predictable "
"patterns and registered implementations are highly-discoverable in the "
"common case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:302
msgid ""
"If a module is defining a new generic operation, it will usually also "
"define any required implementations for existing types in the same place."
"  Likewise, if a module is defining a new type, then it will usually "
"define implementations there for any generic functions that it knows or "
"cares about.  As a result, the vast majority of registered "
"implementations can be found adjacent to either the function being "
"overloaded, or to a newly-defined type for which the implementation is "
"adding support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:311
msgid ""
"It is only in rather infrequent cases that one will have implementations "
"registered in a module that contains neither the function nor the type(s)"
" for which the implementation is added. In the absence of incompetence or"
" deliberate intention to be obscure, the few implementations that are not"
" registered adjacent to the relevant type(s) or function(s), will "
"generally not need to be understood or known about outside the scope "
"where those implementations are defined. (Except in the \"support "
"modules\" case, where best practice suggests naming them accordingly.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:321
msgid ""
"As mentioned earlier, single-dispatch generics are already prolific "
"throughout the standard library. A clean, standard way of doing them "
"provides a way forward to refactor those custom implementations to use a "
"common one, opening them up for user extensibility at the same time."

msgid "Alternative approaches"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:330
msgid ""
"In :pep:`3124` Phillip J. Eby proposes a full-grown solution with "
"overloading based on arbitrary rule sets (with the default implementation"
" dispatching on argument types), as well as interfaces, adaptation and "
"method combining. PEAK-Rules [#peak-rules]_ is a reference implementation"
" of the concepts described in PJE's PEP."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:336
msgid ""
"Such a broad approach is inherently complex, which makes reaching a "
"consensus hard. In contrast, this PEP focuses on a single piece of "
"functionality that is simple to reason about. It's important to note this"
" does not preclude the use of other approaches now or in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0443.rst:341
msgid ""
"In a 2005 article on Artima [#artima2005]_ Guido van Rossum presents a "
"generic function implementation that dispatches on types of all arguments"
" on a function. The same approach was chosen in Andrey Popp's ``generic``"
" package available on PyPI [#pypi-generic]_, as well as David Mertz's "
"``gnosis.magic.multimethods`` [#gnosis-multimethods]_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this seems desirable at first, I agree with Fredrik Lundh's comment"
" that \"if you design APIs with pages of logic just to sort out what code"
" a function should execute, you should probably hand over the API design "
"to someone else\". In other words, the single argument approach proposed "
"in this PEP is not only easier to implement but also clearly communicates"
" that dispatching on a more complex state is an anti-pattern. It also has"
" the virtue of corresponding directly with the familiar method dispatch "
"mechanism in object oriented programming. The only difference is whether "
"the custom implementation is associated more closely with the data "
"(object-oriented methods) or the algorithm (single-dispatch overloading)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PyPy's RPython offers ``extendabletype`` [#pairtype]_, a metaclass which "
