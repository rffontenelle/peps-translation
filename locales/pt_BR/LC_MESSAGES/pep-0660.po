"This document describes a :pep:`517` style method for the installation of "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:24
msgid ""
"Python programmers want to be able to develop packages without having to "
"install (i.e. copy) them into ``site-packages``, for example, by working in "
"a checkout of the source repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:28
msgid ""
"While this can be done by adding the relevant source directories to "
"``PYTHONPATH``, ``setuptools`` provides the ``setup.py develop`` mechanism "
"that makes the process easier, and also installs dependencies and entry "
"points such as console scripts. ``pip`` exposes this mechanism via its ``pip "
"install --editable`` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:34
msgid ""
"The installation of projects in such a way that the python code being "
"imported remains in the source directory is known as the *editable* "
"installation mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:38
msgid ""
"Now that :pep:`517` provides a mechanism to create alternatives to "
"setuptools, and decouple installation front ends from build backends, we "
"need a new mechanism to install packages in editable mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:43
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:45
msgid ""
":pep:`517` deferred \"Editable installs\", meaning non-``setup.py`` "
"distributions lacked that feature. The only way to retain ``editable`` "
"installs for these distributions was to provide a compatible ``setup.py "
"develop`` implementation. By defining an editable hook other build frontends "
"gain parity with ``setup.py``."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:52
msgid "Terminology and goals"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:54
msgid ""
"The editable installation mode implies that the source code of the project "
"being installed is available in a local directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:57
msgid ""
"Once the project is installed in editable mode, users expect that changes to "
"the project *python* code in the local source tree become effective without "
"the need of a new installation step."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:61
msgid ""
"Some kind of changes, such as the addition or modification of entry points, "
"or the addition of new dependencies, require a new installation step to "
"become effective. These changes are typically made in build backend "
"configuration files (such as ``pyproject.toml``), so it is consistent with "
"the general user expectation that *python* source code is imported from the "
"source tree."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:67
msgid ""
"The modification of non-python source code such a C extension modules "
"obviously require a compilation and/or installation step to become "
"effective. The exact steps to perform will remain specific to the build "
"backend used."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:71
msgid ""
"When a project is installed in editable mode, users expect the installation "
"to behave identically as a regular installation. In particular the code must "
"be importable by other code, and metadata must be available to standard "
"mechanisms such as ``importlib.metadata``."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:76
msgid ""
"Depending on the way build backends implement this specification, some minor "
"differences may be visible such as the presence of additional files that are "
"in the source tree and would not be part of a regular install. Build "
"backends are encouraged to document such potential differences."

msgid "The Mechanism"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:84
msgid ""
"This PEP adds three optional hooks to the :pep:`517` backend interface. "
"These hooks are used to build a wheel that, when installed, allows that "
"distribution to be imported from its source folder."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:96
msgid ""
"Must build a ``.whl`` file, and place it in the specified "
"``wheel_directory``. It must return the basename (not the full path) of the ."
"whl file it creates, as a unicode string."
msgstr ""

"May do an in-place build of the distribution as a side effect so that any "
"extension modules or other built artifacts are ready to be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:103
msgid ""
"The .whl file must comply with the Wheel binary file format specification "
"(PEP 427). In particular it must contain a compliant .dist-info directory. "
"Metadata must be identical as the one that would have been produced by "
"``build_wheel`` or ``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel``, except for "
"``Requires-Dist`` which may differ slightly as explained below."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:109
msgid ""
"Build-backends must produce wheels that have the same dependencies "
"(``Requires-Dist`` metadata) as wheels produced by the ``build_wheel`` hook, "
"with the exception that they can add dependencies necessary for their "
"editable mechanism to function at runtime (such as `editables`_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:114
msgid ""
"The filename for the \"editable\" wheel needs to be :pep:`427` compliant "
"too. It does not need to use the same tags as ``build_wheel`` but it must be "
"tagged as compatible with the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:118
msgid ""
"If the build frontend has previously called "
"``prepare_metadata_for_build_editable`` and depends on the wheel resulting "
"from this call to have metadata matching this earlier call, then it should "
"provide the path to the created ``.dist-info`` directory as the "
"``metadata_directory`` argument. If this argument is provided, then "
"``build_editable`` MUST produce a wheel with identical metadata. The "
"directory passed in by the build frontend MUST be identical to the directory "
"created by ``prepare_metadata_for_build_editable``, including any "
"unrecognized files it created."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:127
msgid ""
"An \"editable\" wheel uses the wheel format not for distribution but as "

#: ../pep-0660.rst:186
msgid ""
"The `editables`_ library shows how to build proxy modules that provide a "
"high quality editable installation. It accepts a list of modules to include, "
"and hide. When imported, these proxy modules replace themselves with the "
"code from the source tree. Path-based methods make all scripts under a path "
"importable, often including the project's own ``setup.py`` and other scripts "
"that would not be part of a normal installation. The proxy strategy can "
"achieve a higher level of fidelity than path-based methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0660.rst:193
msgid ""
"Symbolic links are another useful mechanism to realize editable installs. "
"Since, at the time this writing, the ``wheel`` specification does not "
"support symbolic links, they are not directly usable to set-up symbolic "
"links in the target environment. It is however possible for the backend to "
"create a symlink structure in some ``build`` directory of the source tree, "
"and add that directory to the python path via a ``.pth`` file in the "
"\"editable\" wheel. If some files linked in this manner depend on python "
"implementation or version, ABI or platform, care must be taken to generate "
"the link structure in different directories depending on compatibility tags, "
"so the same project tree can be installed in editable mode in multiple "
"environments."
