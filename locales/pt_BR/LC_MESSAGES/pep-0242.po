"This proposal gives the user optional control over the precision and range "

msgid ""
"Currently it is impossible in every language except Fortran 90 to write a "
"program in a portable way that uses floating point and gets roughly the same "
"answer regardless of platform -- or refuses to compile if that is not "
"possible.  Python currently has only one floating point type, equal to a C "
"double in the C implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0242.rst:40
msgid ""
"No type exists corresponding to single or quad floats.  It would complicate "
"the language to try to introduce such types directly and their subsequent "
"use would not be portable.  This proposal is similar to the Fortran 90 "
"\"kind\" solution, adapted to the Python environment.  With this facility an "
"entire calculation can be switched from one level of precision to another by "
"changing a single line.  If the desired precision does not exist on a "
"particular machine, the program will fail rather than get the wrong answer.  "
"Since coding in this style would involve an early call to the routine that "
"will fail, this is the next best thing to not compiling."
