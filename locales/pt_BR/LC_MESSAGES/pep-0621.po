msgid ""
"This PEP specifies how to write a project's `core metadata`_ in a "
"``pyproject.toml`` file for packaging-related tools to consume."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:34
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:36
msgid "The key motivators of this PEP are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:38
msgid ""
"Encourage users to specify core metadata statically for speed, ease of "
"specification, unambiguity, and deterministic consumption by build back-"
"ends"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:41
msgid ""
"Provide a tool-agnostic way of specifying metadata for ease of learning "
"and transitioning between build back-ends"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:43
msgid ""
"Allow for more code sharing between build back-ends for the \"boring "
"parts\" of a project's metadata"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:46
msgid ""
"To speak specifically to the motivation for static metadata, that has "
"been an overall goal of the packaging ecosystem for some time. As such, "
"making it easy to specify metadata statically is important. This also "
"means that raising the cost of specifying data as dynamic is acceptable "
"as users should skew towards wanting to provide static metadata."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:53
msgid ""
"Requiring the distinction between static and dynamic metadata also helps "
"with disambiguation for when metadata isn't specified. When any metadata "
"*may* be dynamic, it means you never know if the absence of metadata is "
"on purpose or because it is to be provided later. By requiring that "
"dynamic metadata be specified, it disambiguates the intent when metadata "
"goes unspecified."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:60
msgid ""
"This PEP does **not** attempt to standardize all possible metadata "
"required by a build back-end, only the metadata covered by the `core "
"metadata`_ specification which are very common across projects and would "
"stand to benefit from being static and consistently specified. This means"
" build back-ends are still free and able to innovate around patterns like"
" how to specify the files to include in a wheel. There is also an "
"included escape hatch for users and build back-ends to use when they "
"choose to partially opt-out of this PEP (compared to opting-out of this "
"PEP entirely, which is also possible)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0621.rst:70
msgid ""
"This PEP is also not trying to change the underlying `core metadata`_ in "
"any way. Such considerations should be done in a separate PEP which may "
"lead to changes or additions to what this PEP specifies."
