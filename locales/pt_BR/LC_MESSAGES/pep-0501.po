"Due to the original design of the ``str.format`` substitution syntax in "
":pep:`3101` being inspired by C#'s string formatting syntax, the specific"
" field substitution syntax used in :pep:`498` is consistent not only with"
" Python's own ``str.format`` syntax, but also with string formatting in "
"C#, including the native \"$-string\" interpolation syntax introduced in "
"C# 6.0 (released in July 2015).  The related ``IFormattable`` interface "
"in C# forms the basis of a `number of elements "

" C#'s internationalization and localization support."

"This means that while this particular substitution syntax may not "
"currently be widely used for translation of *Python* applications (losing"
" out to traditional %-formatting and the designed-specifically-for-i18n "
"``string.Template`` formatting), it *is* a popular translation format in "
"the wider software development ecosystem (since it is already the "
"preferred format for translating C# applications)."
