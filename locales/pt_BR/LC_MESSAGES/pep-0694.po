"There is currently no standardized API for uploading files to a Python "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0694.rst:20

"That API, while functional, leaks a lot of implementation details of the "

"Beyond the above, there are a number of major issues with the current API:"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0694.rst:26

"It is a fully synchronous API, which means that we're forced to have a "

"determine success or failure."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0694.rst:31
msgid ""
"It does not support any mechanism for resuming an upload, with the largest "
"file size on PyPI being just under 1GB in size, that's a lot of wasted "
"bandwidth if a large file has a network blip towards the end of an upload."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0694.rst:35
msgid ""
"It treats a single file as the atomic unit of operation, which can be "
"problematic when a release might have multiple binary wheels which can cause "
"people to get different versions while the files are uploading, and if the "
"sdist happens to not go last, possibly some hard to build packages are "
"attempting to be built from source."
