"This is a very heavy, manual process for core developers. Even in the "

"The planned approach is to use an individual file per news entry, "
"containing the text for the entry. In this scenario, each feature release"
" would have its own directory for news entries and a separate file would "
"be created in that directory that was either named after the issue it "
"closed or a timestamp value (which prevents collisions). Merges across "
"branches would have no issue as the news entry file would still be "
"uniquely named and in the directory of the latest version that contained "
"the fix. A script would collect all news entry files no matter what "
"directory they reside in and create an appropriate news file (the release"
" directory can be ignored as the mere fact that the file exists is enough"
" to represent that the entry belongs to the release). Classification can "
"either be done by keyword in the new entry file itself or by using "
"subdirectories representing each news entry classification in each "
"release directory (or classification of news entries could be dropped "
"since critical information is captured by the \"What's New\" documents "
"which are organized). The benefit of this approach is that it keeps the "
"changes with the code that was actually changed. It also ties the message"
" to being part of the commit which introduced the change. For a commit "
"made through the CLI, a script could be provided to help generate the "
"file. In a bot-driven scenario, the merge bot could have a way to specify"
" a specific news entry and create the file as part of its flattened "
"commit (while most likely also supporting using the first line of the "
"commit message if no specific news entry was specified). If a web-based "
"workflow is used then a status check could be used to verify that a new "
"entry file is in the pull request to act as a reminder that the file is "
"missing. Code for this approach has been written previously for the "
"Mercurial workflow at http://bugs.python.org/issue18967. There is also "

" on  bugs.python.org [#b.p.o]_. This would mean an issue that is marked "
"as \"resolved\" could not be closed until a news entry is added in the "
"\"news\" field in the issue tracker. The benefit of tying the news entry "
"to the issue is it makes sure that all changes worthy of a news entry "
"have an accompanying issue. It also makes classifying a news entry "
"automatic thanks to the Component field of the issue. The Versions field "
"of the issue also ties the news entry to which Python releases were "
"affected. A script would be written to query bugs.python.org for relevant"
" new entries for a release and to produce the output needed to be checked"
" into the code repository. This approach is agnostic to whether a commit "
"was done by CLI or bot. A drawback is that there's a disconnect between "
"the actual commit that made the change and the news entry by having them "
"live in separate places (in this case, GitHub and bugs.python.org). This "
"would mean making a commit would then require remembering to go back to "
"bugs.python.org to add the news entry."
