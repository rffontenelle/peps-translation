"At a high level, the Unladen Swallow JIT compiler works by translating a "
"function's CPython bytecode to platform-specific machine code, using data"
" collected at runtime, as well as classical compiler optimizations, to "
"improve the quality of the generated machine code. Because we only want "
"to spend resources compiling Python code that will actually benefit the "
"runtime of the program, an online heuristic is used to assess how hot a "
"given function is. Once the hotness value for a function crosses a given "
"threshold, it is selected for compilation and optimization. Until a "
"function is judged hot, however, it runs in the standard CPython eval "
"loop, which in Unladen Swallow has been instrumented to record "
"interesting data about each bytecode executed. This runtime data is used "
"to reduce the flexibility of the generated machine code, allowing us to "

"(``slowspitfire``, ``pickle``, ``unpickle``), as well as tools and "
