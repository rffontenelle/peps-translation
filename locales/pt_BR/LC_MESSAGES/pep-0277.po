"This PEP discusses supporting access to all files possible on Windows NT "
"by passing Unicode file names directly to the system's wide-character "
"functions."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:23
msgid ""
"Python 2.2 on Win32 platforms converts Unicode file names passed to open "
"and to functions in the ``os`` module into the 'mbcs' encoding before "
"passing the result to the operating system.  This is often successful in "
"the common case where the script is operating with the locale set to the "
"same value as when the file was created. Most machines are set up as one "
"locale and rarely if ever changed from this locale.  For some users, "
"locale is changed more often and on servers there are often files saved "
"by users using different locales."

msgid ""
"On Windows NT and descendent operating systems, including Windows 2000 "
"and Windows XP, wide-character APIs are available that provide direct "
"access to all file names, including those that are not representable "
"using the current locale.  The purpose of this proposal is to provide "
"access to these wide-character APIs through the standard Python file "
"object and posix module and so provide access to all files on Windows NT."

msgid ""
"On Windows platforms which provide wide-character file APIs, when Unicode"
" arguments are provided to file APIs, wide-character calls are made "
"instead of the standard C library and posix calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:49
msgid ""
"The Python file object is extended to use a Unicode file name argument "
"directly rather than converting it.  This affects the file object "
"constructor ``file(filename[, mode[, bufsize]])`` and also the ``open`` "
"function which is an alias of this constructor.  When a Unicode filename "
"argument is used here then the ``name`` attribute of the file object will"
" be Unicode.  The representation of a file object, ``repr(f)`` will "
"display Unicode file names as an escaped string in a similar manner to "
"the representation of Unicode strings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:59
msgid ""
"The ``posix`` module contains functions that take file or directory "
"names: ``chdir``, ``listdir``, ``mkdir``, ``open``, ``remove``, "
"``rename``, ``rmdir``, ``stat``, and ``_getfullpathname``.  These will "
"use Unicode arguments directly rather than converting them.  For the "
"``rename`` function, this behaviour is triggered when either of the "
"arguments is Unicode and the other argument converted to Unicode using "
"the default encoding."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:67
msgid ""
"The ``listdir`` function currently returns a list of strings.  Under this"
" proposal, it will return a list of Unicode strings when its path "
"argument is Unicode."

msgid "Restrictions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:75
msgid ""
"On the consumer Windows operating systems, Windows 95, Windows 98, and "
"Windows ME, there are no wide-character file APIs so behaviour is "
"unchanged under this proposal.  It may be possible in the future to "
"extend this proposal to cover these operating systems as the VFAT-32 file"
" system used by them does support Unicode file names but access is "
"difficult and so implementing this would require much work.  The "
"\"Microsoft Layer for Unicode\" could be a starting point for "
"implementing this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0277.rst:84
msgid ""
"Python can be compiled with the size of Unicode characters set to 4 bytes"
" rather than 2 by defining ``PY_UNICODE_TYPE`` to be a 4 byte type and "
"``Py_UNICODE_SIZE`` to be 4.  As the Windows API does not accept 4 byte "
"characters, the features described in this proposal will not work in this"
" mode so the implementation falls back to the current 'mbcs' encoding "
"technique. This restriction could be lifted in the future by performing "
"extra conversions using ``PyUnicode_AsWideChar`` but for now that would "
"add too much complexity for a very rarely used feature."
