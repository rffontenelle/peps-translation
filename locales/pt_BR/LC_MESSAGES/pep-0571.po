" wheel that rely on ``glibc``, for example, must be built against version"

#~ "This was originally proposed as "
#~ "``manylinux2``, but the versioning has "
#~ "been changed to use calendar years "
#~ "(also known as CalVer [23]_). This "
#~ "makes it easier to define future "
#~ "*manylinux* tags out of order: for "
#~ "example, a hypothetical ``manylinux2017`` "
#~ "standard may be defined via a new"
#~ " PEP before ``manylinux2014``, or a "
#~ "``manylinux2007`` standard might be defined"
#~ " that targets systems older than this"
#~ " PEP but newer than ``manylinux1``."

#~ "CentOS 5.11 and 6 both include "
#~ "versions of ``glibc`` that depend on "
#~ "the ``vsyscall`` page (2.5 and 2.12.2"
#~ " respectively), so containers based on "
#~ "either cannot run under kernels provided"
#~ " with many distribution's upcoming "
#~ "releases. [17]_ If Travis CI, for "
#~ "example, begins running jobs under a "
#~ "kernel that does not provide the "
#~ "``vsyscall`` interface, Python packagers will"
#~ " not be able to use our Docker"
#~ " images there to build ``manylinux`` "
#~ "wheels. [19]_"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "We have derived a patch from the"
#~ " ``glibc`` git repository that backports"
#~ " the removal of all dependencies on"
#~ " ``vsyscall`` to the version of "
#~ "``glibc`` included with our ``manylinux2010``"
#~ " image. [20]_ Rebuilding ``glibc``, and "
#~ "thus building ``manylinux2010`` image itself,"
#~ " still requires a host kernel that"
#~ " provides the ``vsyscall`` mechanism, but"
#~ " the resulting image can be both "
#~ "run on hosts that provide it and"
#~ " those that do not.  Because the "
#~ "``vsyscall`` interface is an optimization "
#~ "that is only applied to running "
#~ "processes, the ``manylinux2010`` wheels built"
#~ " with this modified image should be"
#~ " identical to those built on an "
#~ "unmodified CentOS 6 system.  Also, the"
#~ " ``vsyscall`` problem applies only to "
#~ "x86_64; it is not part of the "
#~ "i686 ABI."

#~ "The ``auditwheel`` tool has also been"
#~ " updated to produce ``manylinux2010`` "
#~ "wheels. [21]_ Its behavior and purpose"

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As explained in :pep:`513`, the "
#~ "specified symbol versions for ``manylinux1``"
#~ " whitelisted libraries constitute an *upper"
#~ " bound*.  The same is true for "
#~ "the symbol versions defined for "
#~ "``manylinux2010`` in this PEP.  As a "
#~ "result, ``manylinux1`` wheels are considered"
#~ " ``manylinux2010`` wheels.  A ``pip`` that"
#~ " recognizes the ``manylinux2010`` platform "
#~ "tag will thus install ``manylinux1`` "
#~ "wheels for ``manylinux2010`` platforms -- "
#~ "even when explicitly set -- when "
#~ "no ``manylinux2010`` wheels are available. "
