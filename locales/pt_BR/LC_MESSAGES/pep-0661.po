"Unique placeholder values, commonly known as \"sentinel values\", are common "

"Python has the special value ``None``, which is intended to be used as such "
"a sentinel value in most cases.  However, sometimes an alternative sentinel "
"value is needed, usually when it needs to be distinct from ``None``.  These "
"cases are common enough that several idioms for implementing such sentinels "
"have arisen over the years, but uncommon enough that there hasn't been a "
"clear need for standardization.  However, the common implementations, "
"including some in the stdlib, suffer from several significant drawbacks."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:53
msgid ""
"In May 2021, a question was brought up on the python-dev mailing list [1]_ "
"about how to better implement a sentinel value for ``traceback."
"print_exception``.  The existing implementation used the following common "
"idiom::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:60
msgid ""
"However, this object has an uninformative and overly verbose repr, causing "
"the function's signature to be overly long and hard to read::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:70
msgid ""
"Additionally, two other drawbacks of many existing sentinels were brought up "
"in the discussion:"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:73
msgid ""
"Not having a distinct type, hence it being impossible to define clear type "
"signatures for functions with sentinels as default values"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:75
msgid ""
"Incorrect behavior after being copied or unpickled, due to a separate "
"instance being created and thus comparisons using ``is`` failing"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:78
msgid ""
"In the ensuing discussion, Victor Stinner supplied a list of currently used "
"sentinel values in the Python standard library [2]_.  This showed that the "
"need for sentinels is fairly common, that there are various implementation "
"methods used even within the stdlib, and that many of these suffer from at "
"least one of the three aforementioned drawbacks."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:84
msgid ""
"The discussion did not lead to any clear consensus on whether a standard "
"implementation method is needed or desirable, whether the drawbacks "
"mentioned are significant, nor which kind of implementation would be good.  "
"The author of this PEP created an issue on bugs.python.org [3]_ suggesting "
"options for improvement, but that focused on only a single problematic "
"aspect of a few cases, and failed to gather any support."

"A poll [4]_ was created on discuss.python.org to get a clearer sense of the "
"community's opinions. The poll's results were not conclusive, with 40% "
"voting for \"The status-quo is fine / there’s no need for consistency in "
"this\", but most voters voting for one or more standardized solutions. "
"Specifically, 37% of the voters chose \"Consistent use of a new, dedicated "
"sentinel factory / class / meta-class, also made publicly available in the "

"Checking if a value is such a sentinel *should* be done using the ``is`` "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0661.rst:343
msgid ""
"For a long time, the author of this PEP strove to have type signatures for "
"such sentinels that were specific to each value.  A leading proposal "
"(supported by Guido and others) was to expand the use of ``Literal``, e.g. "
"``Literal[MISSING]``.  After much thought and discussion, especially on the "
"typing-sig mailing list [8]_, it seems that all such solutions would require "
"special-casing and/or added complexity in the implementations of static type "
"checkers, while also constraining the implementation of sentinels."

"Therefore, this PEP no longer proposes such signatures.  Instead, this PEP "

"It is somewhat unfortunate that static type checkers will sometimes not be "
"able to deduce more specific types due to this, such as inside a conditional "
"block like ``if value is not MISSING: ...``.  However, this is a minor issue "
"in practice, as type checkers can be easily made to understand these cases "
