"This PEP proposes adding an anchor tag to expose the ``METADATA`` file "
"from distributions in the :pep:`503` \"simple\" repository API. A ``data-"
"dist-info-metadata`` attribute is introduced to indicate that the file "
"from a given distribution can be independently fetched."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:28
msgid ""
"Package management workflows made popular by recent tooling increase the "
"need to inspect distribution metadata without intending to install the "
"distribution, and download multiple distributions of a project to choose "
"from based on their metadata. This means they end up discarding much "
"downloaded data, which is inefficient and results in a bad user "
"experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:37
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:39
msgid ""
"Tools have been exploring methods to reduce the download size by "
"partially downloading wheels with HTTP range requests. This, however, "
"adds additional run-time requirements to the repository server. It also "
"still adds additional overhead, since a separate request is needed to "
"fetch the wheel's file listing to find the correct offset to fetch the "
"metadata file. It is therefore desired to make the server extract the "
"metadata file in advance, and serve it as an independent file to avoid "
"the need to perform additional requests and ZIP inspection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:49
msgid ""
"The metadata file defined by the Core Metadata Specification [core-"
"metadata]_ will be served directly by repositories since it contains the "
"necessary information for common use cases. The metadata must only be "
"served for standards-compliant distributions such as wheels [wheel]_ and "
"sdists [sdist]_, and must be identical to the distribution's canonical "
"metadata file, such as a wheel's ``METADATA`` file in the ``.dist-info`` "
"directory [dist-info]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:57
msgid ""
"An HTML attribute on the distribution file's anchor link is needed to "
"indicate whether a client is able to choose the separately served "
"metadata file. The attribute is also used to provide the metadata "
"content's hash for client-side verification. The attribute's absence "
"indicates that a separate metadata entry is not available for the "
"distribution, either because of the distribution's content, or lack of "
"repository support."

msgid ""
"In a simple repository's project page, each anchor tag pointing to a "
"distribution **MAY** have a ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute. The "
"presence of the attribute indicates the distribution represented by the "
"anchor tag **MUST** contain a Core Metadata file that will not be "
"modified when the distribution is processed and/or installed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:75
msgid ""
"If a ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute is present, the repository "
"**MUST** serve the distribution's Core Metadata file alongside the "
"distribution with a ``.metadata`` appended to the distribution's file "
"name. For example, the Core Metadata of a distribution served at "
"``/files/distribution-1.0-py3.none.any.whl`` would be located at "
"``/files/distribution-1.0-py3.none.any.whl.metadata``. This is similar to"
" how :pep:`503` specifies the GPG signature file's location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:83
msgid ""
"The repository **SHOULD** provide the hash of the Core Metadata file as "
"the ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute's value using the syntax "
"``<hashname>=<hashvalue>``, where ``<hashname>`` is the lower cased name "
"of the hash function used, and ``<hashvalue>`` is the hex encoded digest."
" The repository **MAY** use ``true`` as the attribute's value if a hash "
"is unavailable."

"If an anchor tag lacks the ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute, tools "
"are expected to revert to their current behaviour of downloading the "
"distribution to inspect the metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Older tools not supporting the new ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute "
"are expected to ignore the attribute and maintain their current behaviour"
" of downloading the distribution to inspect the metadata. This is similar"

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:111
msgid ""
"Since tools generally only need dependency information from a "
"distribution in addition to what's already available on the project page,"
" it was proposed that repositories may directly include the information "
"on the project page, like the ``data-requires-python`` attribute "
"specified in :pep:`503`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0658.rst:117
msgid ""
"This approach was abandoned since a distribution may contain arbitrarily "
"long lists of dependencies (including required and optional), and it is "
"unclear whether including the information for every distribution in a "
"project would result in net savings since the information for most "
"distributions generally ends up unneeded. By serving the metadata "
"separately, performance can be better estimated since data usage will be "
"more proportional to the number of distributions inspected."

msgid ""
"It was proposed to provide the entire ``.dist-info`` directory as a "
"separate part, instead of only the metadata file. However, serving "
"multiple files in one entity through HTTP requires re-archiving them "
"separately after they are extracted from the original distribution by the"
" repository server, and there are no current use cases for files other "
"than ``METADATA`` when the distribution itself is not going to be "
"installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An early version of this draft proposed putting the metadata file's URL "
"in the ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute. But people feel it is "
"better for discoverability to require the repository to serve the "
"metadata file at a determined location instead. The current approach also"
" has an additional benefit of making the project page smaller."
