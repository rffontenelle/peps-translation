msgid ""
"**Today, python package installers (pip, easy_install, buildout, and "

"externally hosted files**.  Apart from querying pypi.python.org's simple "
"index pages, also all homepages and download pages ever specified with "
"any release of a package are crawled by an installer. The need for "
"installers to crawl external sites slows down installation and makes for "
"a brittle and unreliable installation process.  Those sites and packages "
"also don't take part in the :pep:`381` mirroring infrastructure, further "
"decreasing reliability and speed of automated installation processes "
"around the world."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0438.rst:137
msgid ""
"Most packages are hosted directly on pypi.python.org [2]_.  Even for "
"these packages, installers still crawl their homepage and download-url, "
"if specified.  Many package uploaders are not aware that specifying the "
"\"homepage\" or \"download-url\" in their package metadata will "
"needlessly slow down the installation process for all users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0438.rst:143
msgid ""
"Relying on third party sites also opens up more attack vectors for "
"injecting malicious packages into sites using automated installs.  A "
"simple attack might just involve getting hold of an old now-unused "
"homepage domain and placing malicious packages there.  Moreover, "
"performing a Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attack between an installation site"
" and any of the download sites can inject malicious packages on the "
"installation site.  As many homepages and download locations are using "
"HTTP and not HTTPS, such attacks are not hard to launch.  Such MITM "
"attacks can easily happen even for packages which never intended to host "
"files externally as their homepages are contacted by installers anyway."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0438.rst:155

"There is currently no way for package maintainers to avoid external-link "
"crawling, other than removing all homepage/download url metadata for all "
"historic releases.  While a script [4]_ has been written to perform this "
"action, it is not a good general solution because it removes useful "
"metadata from PyPI releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0438.rst:161

"Even if the sites referenced by \"Homepage\" and \"Download-URL\" links "
"were not scraped for further links, there is no obvious way under the "

"long_description metadata field (which is shown as package documentation "

"It should remain possible for package owners to choose to host their "

"Automated installer tools should not install externally-hosted packages "
