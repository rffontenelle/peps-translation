"This PEP recommends deprecating and then disabling new uploads of the "

"The groundwork for this proposal was established with :pep:`527`, which "
"proposed deprecating and eventually removing upload support for a handful"
" of un(der)used file extensions and distribution types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0715.rst:40

"In particular, :pep:`527` proposed the removal of the ``bdist_dumb``, "

"distribution types, as well as the ``.tar``, ``.tar.bz2``, ``.tar.xz``, "

"The ``bdist_egg`` filetype identifies distributions in the :term:`egg "
