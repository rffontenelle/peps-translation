msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0011.rst:26
msgid ""
"Over time, the CPython source code has collected various pieces of "
"platform-specific code, which, at some point in time, was considered "
"necessary to use CPython on a specific platform. Without access to this "
"platform, it is not possible to determine whether this code is still "
"needed.  As a result, this code may either break during CPython's "
"evolution, or it may become unnecessary as the platforms evolve as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0011.rst:34
msgid ""
"Allowing these fragments to grow poses the risk of unmaintainability: "
"without having experts for a large number of platforms, it is not "
"possible to determine whether a certain change to the CPython source code"
" will work on all supported platforms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0011.rst:40
msgid ""
"To reduce this risk, this PEP specifies what is required for a platform "
"to be considered supported by CPython as well as providing a procedure to"
" remove code for platforms with few or no CPython users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0011.rst:45

#: ../../peps/pep-0011.rst:57
msgid ""
"To be promoted to a tier, steering council support is required and is "
"expected to be driven by team consensus. Demotion to a lower tier occurs "
"when the requirements of the current tier are no longer met for a "
"platform for an extended period of time based on the judgment of the "
"release manager or steering council. For platforms which no longer meet "
"the requirements of any tier by b1 of a new feature release, an "
"announcement will be made to warn the community of the pending removal of"
" support for the platform (e.g. in the b1 announcement). If the platform "
"is not brought into line for at least one of the tiers by the first "
"release candidate, it will be listed as unsupported in this PEP."
