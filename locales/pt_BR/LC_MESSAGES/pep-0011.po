"Over time, the CPython source code has collected various pieces of platform-"
"specific code, which, at some point in time, was considered necessary to use "
"CPython on a specific platform. Without access to this platform, it is not "
"possible to determine whether this code is still needed.  As a result, this "
"code may either break during CPython's evolution, or it may become "
"unnecessary as the platforms evolve as well."

"any tier by b1 of a new feature release, an announcement will be made to "
