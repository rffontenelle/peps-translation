"This PEP proposes a backwards compatible mechanism that allows "
"``__enter__()`` methods to skip the body of the associated ``with`` "
"statement. The lack of this ability currently means the "
"``contextlib.contextmanager`` decorator is unable to fulfil its "
"specification of being able to turn arbitrary code into a context manager"
" by moving it into a generator function with a yield in the appropriate "
"location. One symptom of this is that ``contextlib.nested`` will "
"currently raise ``RuntimeError`` in situations where writing out the "
"corresponding nested ``with`` statements would not [1]_."

msgid ""
"This PEP was rejected by Guido [4]_ as it imposes too great an increase "
"in complexity without a proportional increase in expressiveness and "

"complex semantics proposed by this PEP the existing behaviour is "
"considered acceptable."

"The semantics of the ``with`` statement will be changed to include a new "
"``try``/``except``/``else`` block around the call to ``__enter__()``. If "
"``SkipStatement`` is raised by the ``__enter__()`` method, then the main "
"section of the ``with`` statement (now located in the ``else`` clause) "
"will not be executed. To avoid leaving the names in any ``as`` clause "
"unbound in this case, a new ``StatementSkipped`` singleton (similar to "
"the existing ``NotImplemented`` singleton) will be assigned to all names "
"that appear in the ``as`` clause."

"Currently, some apparently innocuous context managers may raise "
"``RuntimeError`` when executed. This occurs when the context manager's "
"``__enter__()`` method encounters a situation where the written out "
"version of the code corresponding to the context manager would skip the "
"code that is now the body of the ``with`` statement. Since the "
"``__enter__()`` method has no mechanism available to signal this to the "
"interpreter, it is instead forced to raise an exception that not only "
"skips the body of the ``with`` statement, but also jumps over all code "
"until the nearest exception handler. This goes against one of the design "
"goals of the ``with`` statement, which was to be able to factor out "
"arbitrary common exception handling code into a single context manager by"
" putting into a generator function and replacing the variant part of the "
"code with a ``yield`` statement."

"With the proposed semantic change in place, the contextlib based examples"

msgid ""
"There is currently a tentative suggestion [3]_ to add import-style syntax"
" to the ``with`` statement to allow multiple context managers to be "
"included in a single ``with`` statement without needing to use "
"``contextlib.nested``. In that case the compiler has the option of simply"
" emitting multiple ``with`` statements at the AST level, thus allowing "
"the semantics of actual nested ``with`` statements to be reproduced "
"accurately. However, such a change would highlight rather than alleviate "
"the problem the current PEP aims to address: it would not be possible to "
"use ``contextlib.contextmanager`` to reliably factor out such ``with`` "
"statements, as they would exhibit exactly the same semantic differences "
"as are seen with the ``combined()`` context manager in the above example."

"Implementing the new semantics makes it necessary to store the references"
" to the ``__enter__`` and ``__exit__`` methods in temporary variables "
"instead of on the stack. This results in a slight regression in ``with`` "
"statement speed relative to Python 2.6/3.1. However, implementing a "
"custom ``SETUP_WITH`` opcode would negate any differences between the two"
" approaches (as well as dramatically improving speed by eliminating more "
"than a dozen unnecessary trips around the eval loop)."
