"This PEP explains the need for an additional compatibility mechanism in "

"\"Back to the ``__future__``\", introduced a mechanism for forward "

msgid ""
"From :pep:`236`: \"From time to time, Python makes an incompatible change"
" to the advertised semantics of core language constructs, or changes "
"their accidental (implementation-dependent) behavior in some way. While "
"this is never done capriciously, and is always done with the aim of "
"improving the language over the long term, over the short term it's "
"contentious and disrupting. :pep:`5`, Guidelines for Language Evolution, "
"suggests ways to ease the pain, and this PEP [:pep:`236`] introduces some"
" machinery in support of that.\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:51

"Also from :pep:`236`: \"The purpose of future_statement is to make life "
"easier for people who keep current with the latest release in a timely "
"fashion. We don't hate you if you don't, but your problems are much "
"harder to solve, and somebody with those problems will need to write a "
"PEP addressing them. future_statement is aimed at a different audience.\""

msgid "The current situation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:62
msgid ""
"When an incompatible change to core language syntax or semantics is being"
" made, Python currently provides the future_statement mechanism for "
"providing forward compatibility until the release that enforces the new "
"syntax or semantics, but provides no corresponding standard mechanism for"
" providing backward compatibility after this release."

msgid "Problem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:72
msgid ""
"A consequence of this asymmetry is that, with respect to a breaking "
"change, the older (pre-breaking) version of the Python interpreter is "
"more capable than the newer (breaking) version; the older interpreter can"
" use both code designed prior to the change and newer code, whereas the "
"newer interpreter is only capable of using code that has been upgraded to"
" support the changed feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:79
msgid ""
"As an example, consider the changes to the division operator introduced "
"in :pep:`238` in 2001, soon after :pep:`236` introduced the "
"future_statement mechanism. :pep:`238` outlines a suite of useful "
"forward-compatibility mechanisms for \"true division\" in the Python 2.x "
"series but omits to include any backward-compatibility mechanisms for "
"after \"true division\" was first enforced in Python 3.0. Python versions"
" since 3.0 do not provide a backward compatibility mechanism such as "
"``from __past__ import division`` for code that expects the old \"classic"
" division\" semantics, whereas Python versions prior to 3.0 do support "
"both \"classic division\" code and also forward compatibility with code "
"expecting \"true division\". A further consequence of this is that the "
"\"most compatible\" interpreter with respect to the variety of division-"
"related Python code in the wild is Python 2.7, the version before the "
"breaking change was first enforced."

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:98
msgid ""
"In contrast to this situation, newer versions of application software "
"such as office suites tend to be more capable than earlier versions with "
"respect to their support for loading different versions of their data "
"file formats. The pattern is usually that the newer application versions "
"can transparently load data from either their newer or their older data "
"formats, and that the newer version defaults to saving data in the newer "
"format. Newer application software versions tend to be backward-"
"compatible by default. Forward compatibility is relatively rare."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:108
msgid ""
"This policy puts the user of the newer application software at an "
"advantage over the user of the older software, which is usually incapable"
" of loading data in the newer format. Sometimes it is possible for a user"
" of a newer software application version to export data in an older "
"version by choosing this option explicitly. In these cases, the forward-"
"compatibility this enables may or may not be perfect; some features may "
"be missing or the results may be otherwise suboptimal. Upgrading is "
"therefore easy, whereas downgrading is harder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:118
msgid ""
"The emergent behaviour over many users from such a policy of new "
"attractive features plus backward compatibility features is that a "
"natural pressure builds up on each individual user to upgrade his or her "
"own application version, and, the more other users an individual "
"exchanges data files with, the more acute this pressure becomes."

"future Python versions after the breaking change is adopted by default, "

msgid ""
"As an example of how this PEP is to be applied, if the latest revision of"

"considered incomplete. :pep:`238` notes the \"severe backwards "
"compatibility issues\" raised by the proposal and describes several "
"measures for forward compatibility in the Abstract and API Changes "
"sections. It also mentions some backward compatibility ideas raised on "
"c.l.py, including \"Use ``from __past__ import division`` to use classic "

"backward compatibility plan as part of the proposal."

msgid ""
"If this PEP is accepted, it would be expected that a proposal such as "
":pep:`238`, because of its large-scale compatibility implications, would "

"to re-enable the classic division behaviour easily in their code."

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:216
msgid ""
"The benefit to Python-dev of adopting this proposal is that future "

"and can be invoked easily by users of future Python versions. This can "
"help the language to evolve more quickly and more effectively to correct "
"for design mistakes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:223
msgid ""
"The benefit to conservative users is obvious: they can add support for "
"the latest shiny compatibility-breaking Python version to their code "
"merely by adding a ``__past__`` incantation (perhaps a single line) to "
"each module, and that this can be automated. They can then upgrade their "
"interpreter to the latest version and gain access to the latest shiny "
"Python features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0497.rst:230
msgid ""
"The benefit to the community is that, if ten thousand users rely on "
"package XYZ, and package XYZ can trivially add support for the latest "
"Python version, those ten thousand users can also upgrade to the latest "
"Python version quickly, without being held back waiting for package XYZ "
"to do this."

"A1: Definitely not. Legacy features can still be phased out when "

"to the newer Python version. This PEP merely proposes to shift the "
"emphasis of the development effort directed at compatibility from 100% "
