msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0509.rst:28
msgid ""
"In Python, the builtin ``dict`` type is used by many instructions. For "
"example, the ``LOAD_GLOBAL`` instruction looks up a variable in the "
"global namespace, or in the builtins namespace (two dict lookups). Python"
" uses ``dict`` for the builtins namespace, globals namespace, type "
"namespaces, instance namespaces, etc. The local namespace (function "
"namespace) is usually optimized to an array, but it can be a dict too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0509.rst:35
msgid ""
"Python is hard to optimize because almost everything is mutable: builtin "
"functions, function code, global variables, local variables, ... can be "
"modified at runtime. Implementing optimizations respecting the Python "
"semantics requires to detect when \"something changes\": we will call "
"these checks \"guards\"."
msgstr ""

"The speedup of optimizations depends on the speed of guard checks. This "

msgid ""
"Dictionary lookups can be skipped if the version does not change, which "
"is the common case for most namespaces. The version is globally unique, "

"dictionary was not replaced with a new dictionary."
msgstr ""

"complexity is O(1)."

msgid ""
"Example of optimization: copy the value of a global variable to function "
"constants.  This optimization requires a guard on the global variable to "
"check if it was modified after it was copied. If the global variable is "
"not modified, the function uses the cached copy. If the global variable "
"is modified, the function uses a regular lookup, and maybe also "
"deoptimizes the function (to remove the overhead of the guard check for "
"next function calls)."
