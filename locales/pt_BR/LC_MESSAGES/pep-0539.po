msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:225
msgid ""
"The original TLS API was added to Python by GvR back in 1997, and at the "
"time the key used to represent a TLS value was an ``int``, and so it has "
"been to the time of writing.  This used CPython's own TLS implementation "
"which long remained unused, largely unchanged, in Python/thread.c.  "
"Support for implementation of the API on top of native thread "
"implementations (pthreads and Windows) was added much later, and the "
"built-in implementation has been deemed no longer necessary and has since"
" been removed [9]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:233
msgid ""
"The problem with the choice of ``int`` to represent a TLS key, is that "
"while it was fine for CPython's own TLS implementation, and happens to be"
" compatible with Windows (which uses ``DWORD`` for the analogous data), "
"it is not compatible with the POSIX standard for the pthreads API, which "
"defines ``pthread_key_t`` as an opaque type not further defined by the "
"standard (as with ``Py_tss_t`` described above) [14]_.  This leaves it up"
" to the underlying implementation how a ``pthread_key_t`` value is used "
"to look up thread-specific data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:242
msgid ""
"This has not generally been a problem for Python's API, as it just "
"happens that on Linux ``pthread_key_t`` is defined as an ``unsigned "
"int``, and so is fully compatible with Python's TLS "
"API--``pthread_key_t``'s created by ``pthread_create_key`` can be freely "
"cast to ``int`` and back (well, not exactly, even this has some "
"limitations as pointed out by issue #22206)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:248

"However, as issue #25658 points out, there are at least some platforms "
"(namely Cygwin, CloudABI, but likely others as well) which have otherwise"
" modern and POSIX-compliant pthreads implementations, but are not "
"compatible with Python's API because their ``pthread_key_t`` is defined "
"in a way that cannot be safely cast to ``int``.  In fact, the possibility"
" of running into this problem was raised by MvL at the time pthreads TLS "
"was added [2]_."

"It could be argued that :pep:`11` makes specific requirements for "
"supporting a new, not otherwise officially-support platform (such as "
"CloudABI), and that the status of Cygwin support is currently dubious.  "
"However, this creates a very high barrier to supporting platforms that "
"are otherwise Linux- and/or POSIX-compatible and where CPython might "
"otherwise \"just work\" except for this one hurdle.  CPython itself "
"imposes this implementation barrier by way of an API that is not "

msgid ""
"The use of an opaque type (``Py_tss_t``) to key TLS values allows the API"
" to be compatible with all present (POSIX and Windows) and future (C11?) "
"native TLS implementations supported by CPython, as it allows the "
"definition of ``Py_tss_t`` to depend on the underlying implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:273
msgid ""
"Since the existing TLS API has been available in *the limited API* [13]_ "
"for some platforms (e.g. Linux), CPython makes an effort to provide the "
"new TSS API at that level likewise.  Note, however, that the ``Py_tss_t``"
" definition becomes to be an opaque struct when ``Py_LIMITED_API`` is "
"defined, because exposing ``NATIVE_TSS_KEY_T`` as part of the limited API"
" would prevent us from switching native thread implementation without "
"rebuilding extension modules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:281
msgid ""
"A new API must be introduced, rather than changing the function "
"signatures of the current API, in order to maintain backwards "
"compatibility.  The new API also more clearly groups together these "
"related functions under a single name prefix, ``PyThread_tss_``.  The "
"\"tss\" in the name stands for \"thread-specific storage\", and was "
"influenced by the naming and design of the \"tss\" API that is part of "
"the C11 threads API [15]_.  However, this is in no way meant to imply "
"compatibility with or support for the C11 threads API, or signal any "
"future intention of supporting C11--it's just the influence for the "
"naming and design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0539.rst:290
msgid ""
"The inclusion of the special initializer ``Py_tss_NEEDS_INIT`` is "
"required by the fact that not all native TLS implementations define a "
"sentinel value for uninitialized TLS keys.  For example, on Windows a TLS"
" key is represented by a ``DWORD`` (``unsigned int``) and its value must "
"be treated as opaque [3]_.  So there is no unsigned integer value that "
"can be safely used to represent an uninitialized TLS key on Windows.  "
"Likewise, POSIX does not specify a sentinel for an uninitialized "
"``pthread_key_t``, instead relying on the ``pthread_once`` interface to "
"ensure that a given TLS key is initialized only once per-process.  "
"Therefore, the ``Py_tss_t`` type contains an explicit "
"``._is_initialized`` that can indicate the key's initialization state "
"independent of the underlying implementation."

"Changing ``PyThread_create_key`` to immediately return a failure status "

"is intended as a sanity check:  Currently, ``PyThread_create_key`` may "
"report initial success on such systems, but attempts to use the returned "
"key are likely to fail.  Although in practice this failure occurs earlier"
" in the interpreter initialization, it's better to fail immediately at "
"the source of problem (``PyThread_create_key``) rather than sometime "
"later when use of an invalid key is attempted.  In other words, this "
