msgid ""
"Several very good IP address modules for python already exist. The truth "
"is that all of them struggle with the balance between adherence to "
"Pythonic principals and the shorthand upon which network engineers and "
"administrators rely.  ``ipaddress`` aims to strike the right balance."

"The existence of several Python IP address manipulation modules is "

msgid ""
"The ``ipaddr`` module defines a total of 6 new public classes, 3 for "
"manipulating IPv4 objects and 3 for manipulating IPv6 objects. The "
"classes are as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3144.rst:95
msgid ""
"``IPv4Address``/``IPv6Address`` - These define individual addresses, for "
"example the IPv4 address returned by an A record query for www.google.com"
" (74.125.224.84) or the IPv6 address returned by a AAAA record query for "
"ipv6.google.com (2001:4860:4001:801::1011)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3144.rst:100
msgid ""
"``IPv4Network``/``IPv6Network`` - These define networks or groups of "
"addresses, for example the IPv4 network reserved for multicast use "
"(224.0.0.0/4) or the IPv6 network reserved for multicast (ff00::/8, wow, "
"that's big)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-3144.rst:105
msgid ""
"``IPv4Interface``/``IPv6Interface`` - These hybrid classes refer to an "
"individual address on a given network.  For example, the IPV4 address "
"192.0.2.1 on the network 192.0.2.0/24 could be referred to as "
"192.0.2.1/24.  Likewise, the IPv6 address 2001:DB8::1 on the network "
"2001:DB8::/96 could be referred to as 2001:DB8::1/96. It's very common to"
" refer to addresses assigned to computer network interfaces like this, "
"hence the Interface name."

"All IPv4 classes share certain characteristics and methods; the number of"

"Comparisons between objects of differing IP versions results in a "
"``TypeError`` [1]_.  Additionally, comparisons of objects with different "
"_Base parent classes results in a ``TypeError``.  The effect of the _Base"
