msgid ""
"The question of \"multi-line lambdas\" has been a vexing one for many "
"Python users for a very long time, and it took an exploration of Ruby's "
"block functionality for me to finally understand why this bugs people so "
"much: Python's demand that the function be named and introduced before "
"the operation that needs it breaks the developer's flow of thought. They "
"get to a point where they go \"I need a one-shot operation that does "
"<X>\", and instead of being able to just *say* that directly, they "
"instead have to back up, name a function to do <X>, then call that "
"function from the operation they actually wanted to do in the first "
"place. Lambda expressions can help sometimes, but they're no substitute "
"for being able to use a full suite."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:172
msgid ""
"Ruby's block syntax also heavily inspired the style of the solution in "
"this PEP, by making it clear that even when limited to *one* anonymous "
"function per statement, anonymous functions could still be incredibly "
"useful. Consider how many constructs Python has where one expression is "
"responsible for the bulk of the heavy lifting:"

"However, adopting Ruby's block syntax directly won't work for Python, "
"since the effectiveness of Ruby's blocks relies heavily on various "
"conventions in the way functions are *defined* (specifically, using "
"Ruby's ``yield`` syntax to call blocks directly and the ``&arg`` "
"mechanism to accept a block as a function's final argument)."

"Since Python has relied on named functions for so long, the signatures of"

":pep:`3150` (Statement Local Namespaces) describes its primary motivation"
" as being to elevate ordinary assignment statements to be on par with "
"``class`` and ``def`` statements where the name of the item to be defined"
" is presented to the reader in advance of the details of how the value of"
" that item is calculated. This PEP achieves the same goal in a different "
"way, by allowing the simple name binding of a standard function "
"definition to be replaced with something else (like assigning the result "
"of the function to a value)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:212
msgid ""
"Despite having the same author, the two PEPs are in direct competition "
"with each other. :pep:`403` represents a minimalist approach that "
"attempts to achieve useful functionality with a minimum of change from "
"the status quo. This PEP instead aims for a more flexible standalone "
"statement design, which requires a larger degree of change to the "
"language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:218
msgid ""
"Note that where :pep:`403` is better suited to explaining the behaviour "
"of generator expressions correctly, this PEP is better able to explain "

msgid ""
"The proposal definitely requires *some* kind of prefix to avoid parsing "
"ambiguity and backwards compatibility problems with existing constructs. "
"It also needs to be clearly highlighted to readers, since it declares "
"that the following piece of code is going to be executed only after the "
"trailing function or class definition has been executed."
msgstr ""

"denote the concept of a forward reference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:236
msgid ""
"The ``@`` prefix was included in order to exploit the fact that Python "
"programmers are already used to decorator syntax as an indication of out "

"*first* and then decorators are applied in reverse order."

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:251
msgid ""
"One of the objections to widespread use of lambda expressions is that "
"they have a negative effect on traceback intelligibility and other "
"aspects of introspection. Similar objections are raised regarding "
"constructs that promote short, cryptic function names (including this "
"one, which requires that the name of the trailing definition be supplied "
"at least twice, encouraging the use of shorthand placeholder names like "
"``f``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:258
msgid ""
"However, the introduction of qualified names in :pep:`3155` means that "
"even anonymous classes and functions will now have different "
"representations if they occur in different scopes. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:268
msgid ""
"Anonymous functions (or functions that share a name) within the *same* "
"scope will still share representations (aside from the object ID), but "

msgid ""
"The ``@in`` clause will be included in the AST for the associated "
"function or class definition and the statement that references it. When "

"The one potentially tricky part is changing the meaning of the references"
" to the statement local function or namespace while within the scope of "

msgid ""
"The problems with using a full nested suite are best described in "
":pep:`3150`. It's comparatively difficult to implement properly, the "
"scoping semantics are harder to explain and it creates quite a few "
"situations where there are two ways to do it without clear guidelines for"
" choosing between them (as almost any construct that can be expressed "
"with ordinary imperative code could instead be expressed using a given "
"statement). While the PEP does propose some new :pep:`8` guidelines to "
"help address that last problem, the difficulties in implementation are "
"not so easily dealt with."

msgid ""
"By contrast, the decorator inspired syntax in this PEP explicitly limits "
"the new feature to cases where it should actually improve readability, "
"rather than harming it. As in the case of the original introduction of "
"decorators, the idea of this new syntax is that if it *can* be used (i.e."
" the local name binding of the function is completely unnecessary) then "
"it probably *should* be used."

#: ../../peps/pep-0403.rst:482
msgid ""
"There are a couple of problems with this approach. The main issue is that"
" this syntax variant uses something that looks like a suite, but really "
"isn't one. A secondary concern is that it's not clear how the compiler "
"will know which name(s) in the leading expression are forward references "

"definition of the suite-that-is-not-a-suite in the language grammar)."
