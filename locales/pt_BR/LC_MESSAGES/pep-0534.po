"Many Linux and other distributions are already separating out parts of the "

"modules are the ``tkinter`` module, since it draws in a dependency on the "
"graphical environment, ``idlelib``, since it depends on ``tkinter`` (and "
"most Linux desktop environments provide their own default code editor), and "
"the ``test`` package, as it only serves to test Python internally and is "
"about as big as the rest of the standard library put together."

"The methods of omission of these modules differ.  For example, Debian "

"it simply adds the following to the error message: ``please install the "

#: ../pep-0534.txt:299
msgid ""
"However, the platform dependence is at least tracked at the level of "
"\"Windows\", \"Unix\", \"Linux\", and \"FreeBSD\" for the benefit of `the "
