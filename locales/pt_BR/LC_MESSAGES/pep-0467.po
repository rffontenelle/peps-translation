#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:30
msgid ""
"During the initial development of the Python 3 language specification, the "
"core ``bytes`` type for arbitrary binary data started as the mutable type "
"that is now referred to as ``bytearray``. Other aspects of operating in the "
"binary domain in Python have also evolved over the course of the Python 3 "
"series, for example with :pep:`461`."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:40
msgid ""
"With Python 3 and the split between ``str`` and ``bytes``, one small but "
"important area of programming became slightly more difficult, and much more "
"painful -- wire format protocols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:44
msgid ""
"This area of programming is characterized by a mixture of binary data and "
"ASCII compatible segments of text (aka ASCII-encoded text).  The addition of "
"the new constructors, methods, and iterators will aid both in writing new "
"wire format code, and in porting any remaining Python 2 wire format code."

"Addition of explicit \"count and byte initialised sequence\" constructors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:59
msgid ""
"To replace the discouraged behavior of creating zero-filled ``bytes``-like "
"objects from the basic constructors (i.e. ``bytes(1)`` --> ``b'\\x00'``), "
"this PEP proposes the addition of an explicit ``fromsize`` alternative "
"constructor as a class method on both ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` whose "
"first argument is the count, and whose second argument is the fill byte to "
"use (defaults to ``\\x00``)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:75

"``fromsize`` will behave just as the current constructors behave when passed "

"The documentation of the ``ord`` builtin will be updated to explicitly note "
"that ``bytes.fromint`` is the primary inverse operation for binary data, "
"while ``chr`` is the inverse operation for text data, and that ``bytearray."
"fromint`` also exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/peps/pep-0467.rst:108

"Behaviorally, ``bytes.fromint(x)`` will be equivalent to the current "
"``bytes([x])`` (and similarly for ``bytearray``). The new spelling is "

"in conjunction with indexing operations on binary sequence types)."

msgid ""
"These new methods intentionally do NOT offer the same level of general "
"integer support as the existing ``int.to_bytes`` conversion method, which "
"allows arbitrarily large integers to be converted to arbitrarily long bytes "
"objects. The restriction to only accept positive integers that fit in a "
"single byte means that no byte order information is needed, and there is no "
"need to handle negative numbers. The documentation of the new methods will "
"refer readers to ``int.to_bytes`` for use cases where handling of arbitrary "

"This PEP isn't revisiting that original design decision, just changing the "
