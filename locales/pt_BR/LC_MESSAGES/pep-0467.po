msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:30
msgid ""
"During the initial development of the Python 3 language specification, "
"the core ``bytes`` type for arbitrary binary data started as the mutable "
"type that is now referred to as ``bytearray``. Other aspects of operating"
" in the binary domain in Python have also evolved over the course of the "
"Python 3 series, for example with :pep:`461`."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:40
msgid ""
"With Python 3 and the split between ``str`` and ``bytes``, one small but "
"important area of programming became slightly more difficult, and much "
"more painful -- wire format protocols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:44
msgid ""
"This area of programming is characterized by a mixture of binary data and"
" ASCII compatible segments of text (aka ASCII-encoded text).  The "
"addition of the new constructors, methods, and iterators will aid both in"
" writing new wire format code, and in porting any remaining Python 2 wire"
" format code."

msgid "Addition of explicit \"count and byte initialised sequence\" constructors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:59
msgid ""
"To replace the now discouraged behavior, this PEP proposes the addition "
"of an explicit ``fromsize`` alternative constructor as a class method on "
"both ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` whose first argument is the count, and "
"whose second argument is the fill byte to use (defaults to ``\\x00``)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:73
msgid ""
"``fromsize`` will behave just as the current constructors behave when "
"passed a single integer, while allowing for non-zero fill values when "
"needed."

"The documentation of the ``ord`` builtin will be updated to explicitly "

"``bytearray.fromint`` also exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:106
msgid ""
"Behaviorally, ``bytes.fromint(x)`` will be equivalent to the current "
"``bytes([x])`` (and similarly for ``bytearray``). The new spelling is "
"expected to be easier to discover and easier to read (especially when "
"used in conjunction with indexing operations on binary sequence types)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:111

"As a separate method, the new spelling will also work better with higher "
"order functions like ``map``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:114
msgid ""
"These new methods intentionally do NOT offer the same level of general "
"integer support as the existing ``int.to_bytes`` conversion method, which"
" allows arbitrarily large integers to be converted to arbitrarily long "
"bytes objects. The restriction to only accept positive integers that fit "
"in a single byte means that no byte order information is needed, and "
"there is no need to handle negative numbers. The documentation of the new"
" methods will refer readers to ``int.to_bytes`` for use cases where "
"handling of arbitrary integers is needed."

"However, this was also the case when the ``bytearray`` type was "

msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0467.rst:204
msgid ""
"This PEP isn't revisiting that original design decision, just changing "
"the spelling as users sometimes find the current behavior of the binary "
"sequence constructors surprising. In particular, there's a reasonable "
"case to be made that ``bytes(x)`` (where ``x`` is an integer) should "
"behave like the ``bytes.fromint(x)`` proposal in this PEP. Providing both"

"When submitted to the Steering Council, this PEP proposed the "

"The SC indicated they didn't think this functionality was needed often "
