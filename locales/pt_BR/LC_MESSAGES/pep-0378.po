"The locale module presents two other challenges.  First, it is a global "
"setting and not suitable for multi-threaded apps that need to serve-up "
"requests in multiple locales.  Second, the name of a relevant locale "
"(such as \"de_DE\") can vary from platform to platform or may not be "
"defined at all.  The docs for the locale module describe these and `many "
"other challenges`_ in detail."

"It is not the goal to replace the locale module, to perform "
"internationalization tasks, or accommodate every possible convention.  "

"The ',' option indicates that commas should be included in the output as "

"Another thought is that embedding some particular convention in "

"There are some precedents for grouping digits in the fractional part of a"

"James Knight observed that Indian/Pakistani numbering systems group by "
"hundreds.   Ben Finney noted that Chinese group by ten-thousands.  Eric "
"Smith pointed-out that these are already handled by the \"n\" specifier "
"in the locale module (albeit only for integers).  This PEP does not "
"attempt to support all of those possibilities.  It focuses on a single, "
"relatively common grouping convention that offers a quick way to improve "
"readability in many (though not all) contexts."
