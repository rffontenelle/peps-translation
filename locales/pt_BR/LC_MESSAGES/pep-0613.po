#: ../pep-0613.rst:26
msgid ""
"Type aliases are declared as top level variable assignments. In :pep:`PEP "
"484 <484#type-aliases>`, the distinction between a valid type alias and a "
"global variable was implicitly determined: if a top level assignment is "
"unannotated, and the assigned value is a valid type, then the name being "
"assigned to is a valid type alias. Otherwise, that name is simply a global "
"value that cannot be used as a type hint."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0613.rst:33
msgid ""
"These implicit type alias declaration rules create confusion when type "
"aliases involve forward references, invalid types, or violate other "
"restrictions enforced on type alias declaration. Because the distinction "
"between an unannotated value and a type alias is implicit, ambiguous or "
"incorrect type alias declarations implicitly default to a valid value "
"assignment. This creates expressions that are impossible to express as type "
"aliases and punts error diagnosis of malformed type aliases downstream."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0613.rst:41
msgid ""
"The following examples each include an illustration of some of the "
"suboptimal or confusing behaviors resulting from existing implicit alias "
"declarations. We also introduce explicit aliases of the format ``TypeName: "
"TypeAlias = Expression`` here for the sake of comparison, but the syntax is "
"discussed in further detail in later sections."

"This code snippet should not error so long as ``ClassName`` is defined later "
"on. However, a type checker is forced to assume that MyType is a value "
"assignment rather than a type alias, and therefore may throw spurious errors "
"that (1) ``MyType`` is an unannotated global string, and (2) ``MyType`` "
"cannot be used as a return annotation because it is not a valid type."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0613.rst:66
msgid ""
"Explicit aliases remove ambiguity so neither of the above errors will be "
"thrown. Additionally, if something is wrong with ``ClassName`` (i.e., it’s "
"not actually defined later), the type checker can throw an error."

"A type checker should warn on this code snippet that ``InvalidType`` is not "
"a valid type, and therefore cannot be used to annotate an expression or to "
"construct a type alias. Instead, type checkers are forced to throw spurious "
"errors that (1) ``MyType`` is a global expression missing an annotation, and "

"With explicit aliases, the type checker has enough information to error on "
"the actual definition of the bad type alias, and explain why: that "

"errors on all usages of ``MyType`` across the codebase can be suppressed."

msgid ""
"The outer ``x`` is a valid type alias, but type checkers must error if the "
"inner ``x`` is ever used as a type because type aliases cannot be defined "
"inside of a function. This is confusing because the alias declaration rule "
"is not explicit, and because a type error will not be thrown on the location "
"of the inner type alias declaration but rather on every one of its "
"subsequent use cases."

"With explicit aliases, the outer assignment is still a valid type variable. "
"Inside ``foo``, the inner assignment should be interpreted as ``x: "

"The explicit alias declaration syntax clearly differentiates between the "
"three possible kinds of assignments: typed global expressions, untyped "
