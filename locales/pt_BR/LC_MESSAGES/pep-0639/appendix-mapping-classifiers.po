"Most single license classifiers (namely, all those not mentioned below) "
"map to a single valid SPDX license identifier, allowing tools to infer "
"the SPDX license identifier they correspond to, both for use when "
"analyzing and auditing packages, and providing a semi-automated mechanism"
" of filling the ``license`` key or the ``License-Expression`` field "
"following the :ref:`PEP 639 specification <639-spec-converting-"

"Some legacy license classifiers intend to specify a particular license, "

"`critical ambiguity <classifierissue_>`__ as to their terms, "
"compatibility and acceptability. Tools MUST NOT attempt to automatically "
