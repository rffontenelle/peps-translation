"In the `Setuptools <setuptoolssdist_>`__ and `Wheel <wheels_>`__ "

"info`` directory of a built wheel) if they match one of a number of "
"common license file name patterns (``LICEN[CS]E*``, ``COPYING*``, "
"``NOTICE*`` and ``AUTHORS*``). Alternatively, a package author can "
"specify a list of license file paths to include in the built wheel under "
"the ``license_files`` key in the ``[metadata]`` section of the project's "
"``setup.cfg``, or as an argument to the ``setuptools.setup()`` function. "
"At present, following the Wheel project's lead, Setuptools flattens the "
"collected license files into the metadata directory, clobbering files "
