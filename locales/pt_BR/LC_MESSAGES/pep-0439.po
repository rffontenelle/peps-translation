#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:34
msgid ""
"This PEP has been rejected in favour of a more explicit mechanism that "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:41
msgid ""
"Currently the user story for installing 3rd-party Python modules is not "
"as simple as it could be.  It requires that all 3rd-party modules inform "
"the user of how to install the installer, typically via a link to the "
"installer.  That link may be out of date or the steps required to perform"
" the install of the installer may be enough of a roadblock to prevent the"
" user from further progress."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:48
msgid ""
"Large Python projects which emphasise a low barrier to entry have shied "
"away from depending on third party packages because of the introduction "
"of this potential stumbling block for new users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:52
msgid ""
"With the inclusion of the package installer command in the standard "
"Python installation the barrier to installing additional software is "
"considerably reduced.  It is hoped that this will therefore increase the "
"likelihood that Python projects will reuse third party software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:57
msgid ""
"The Python community also has an issue of complexity around the current "
"bootstrap procedure for pip and setuptools. They all have their own "
"bootstrap download file with slightly different usages and even refer to "
"each other in some cases. Having a single bootstrap which is common "
"amongst them all, with a simple usage, would be far preferable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:63
msgid ""
"It is also hoped that this is reduces the number of proposals to include "
"more and more software in the Python standard library, and therefore that"
" more popular Python software is more easily upgradeable beyond requiring"
" Python installation upgrades."

"This proposal affects two components of packaging: `the pip bootstrap`_ "
"and, thanks to easier package installation, `modifications to publishing "
"packages`_."

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:79

msgid "The pip bootstrap"
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:86
msgid ""
"The Python installation includes an executable called \"pip3\" (see "
":pep:`394` for naming rationale etc.) that attempts to import pip "
"machinery.  If it can then the pip command proceeds as normal.  If it "
"cannot it will bootstrap pip by downloading the pip implementation and "
"setuptools wheel files. Hereafter the installation of the \"pip "
"implementation\" will imply installation of setuptools and virtualenv.  "
"Once installed, the pip command proceeds as normal. Once the bootstrap "
"process is complete the \"pip3\" command is no longer the bootstrap but "
"rather the full pip command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../peps/pep-0439.rst:95
msgid ""
"A bootstrap is used in the place of a the full pip code so that we don't "

"Python upgrade timeframe and processes."

msgid ""
"To avoid issues with sudo we will have the bootstrap default to "
"installing the pip implementation to the per-user site-packages directory"
" defined in :pep:`370` and implemented in Python 2.6/3.0.  Since we avoid"
" installing to the system Python we also avoid conflicting with any other"

"An additional new Python package is proposed, \"pypublish\", which will "
"be a tool for publishing packages to PyPI.  It would replace the current "
"\"python setup.py register\" and \"python setup.py upload\" distutils "
"commands.  Again because of the measured Python release cycle and "
"extensive existing Python installations these commands are difficult to "
"bugfix and extend.  Additionally it is desired that the \"register\" and "
"\"upload\" commands be able to be performed over HTTPS with certificate "
"validation.  Since shipping CA certificate keychains with Python is not "
"really feasible (updating the keychain is quite difficult to manage) it "
"is desirable that those commands, and the accompanying keychain, be made "
"installable and upgradeable outside of Python itself."

"Finally, it would be desirable that \"pip3\" be ported to Python 2.6+ to "
